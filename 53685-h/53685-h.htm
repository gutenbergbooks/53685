<span id="respectfully">Respectfully inscribed by</span><br />

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_ix" title="ix"> </a>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="small-caps">The</span> hint of this Romance (or Tale) was
taken from a passage in one of my Sermons,
which (as it is to be presumed very
few have read) I shall here take the liberty
to quote. The passage is this.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“At this moment is there one of us
present, however we may have departed
from the Lord, disobeyed his will, and
disregarded his word&mdash;is there one of
us who would, at this moment, accept
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_x" title="x"> </a>all that man could bestow, or earth afford,
to resign the hope of his salvation?&mdash;No,
there is not one&mdash;not such a fool
on earth, were the enemy of mankind
to traverse it with the offer!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This passage suggested the idea of
“Melmoth the Wanderer.” The Reader
will find that idea developed in the following
pages, with what power or success <em>he</em>
is to decide.</p>

<p>The “Spaniard’s Tale” has been censured
by a friend to whom I read it, as containing
too much attempt at the revivification
of the horrors of Radcliffe-Romance,
of the persecutions of convents, and the
terrors of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>I defended myself, by trying to point
out to my friend, that I had made the
misery of conventual life depend less on
the startling adventures one meets with in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xi" title="xi"> </a>
romances, than on that irritating series of
petty torments which constitutes the misery
of life in general, and which, amid
the tideless stagnation of monastic existence,
solitude gives its inmates leisure to
invent, and power combined with malignity,
the full disposition to practise. I
trust this defence will operate more on the
conviction of the Reader, than it did on
that of my friend.</p>

<p>For the rest of the Romance, there are
some parts of it which I have borrowed
from real life.</p>

<p>The story of John Sandal and Elinor
Mortimer is founded in fact.</p>

<p>The original from which the Wife of
Walberg is imperfectly sketched is a living
woman, and <em>long may she live</em>.</p>

<p>I cannot again appear before the public
in so unseemly a character as that of a
writer of romances, without regretting the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_xii" title="xii"> </a>
necessity that compels me to it. Did my
profession furnish me with the means of
subsistence, I should hold myself culpable
indeed in having recourse to any other,
but&mdash;am I allowed the choice?</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="small-caps">In</span> the autumn of 1816, John Melmoth,
a student in Trinity College, Dublin, quitted
it to attend a dying uncle on whom his
hopes for independence chiefly rested. John
was the orphan son of a younger brother,
whose small property scarce could pay
John’s college expences; but the uncle was
rich, unmarried, and old; and John,
from his infancy, had been brought up
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_2" title="2"> </a>
to look on him with that mingled sensation
of awe, and of the wish, without
the means to conciliate, (that sensation
at once attractive and repulsive),
with which we regard a being who (as
nurse, domestic, and parent have tutored
us to believe) holds the very threads of
our existence in his hands, and may prolong
or snap them when he pleases.</p>

<p>On receiving this summons, John set
immediately out to attend his uncle.</p>

<p>The beauty of the country through
which he travelled (it was the county
Wicklow) could not prevent his mind
from dwelling on many painful thoughts,
some borrowed from the past, and more
from the future. His uncle’s caprice and
moroseness,&mdash;the strange reports concerning
the cause of the secluded life he had led
for many years,&mdash;his own dependent state,&mdash;fell
like blows fast and heavy on his
mind. He roused himself to repel them,&mdash;sat
up in the mail, in which he was a
solitary passenger,&mdash;looked out on the prospect,&mdash;consulted
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_3" title="3"> </a>
his watch;&mdash;then he
thought they receded for a moment,&mdash;but
there was nothing to fill their place, and
he was forced to invite them back for
company. When the mind is thus active
in calling over invaders, no wonder the
conquest is soon completed. As the carriage
drew near the Lodge, (the name of
old Melmoth’s seat), John’s heart grew
heavier every moment.</p>

<p>The recollection of this awful uncle
from infancy,&mdash;when he was never permitted
to approach him without innumerable
lectures,&mdash;<em>not to be troublesome</em>,&mdash;not
to go too near his uncle,&mdash;not to ask him
any questions,&mdash;on no account to disturb
the inviolable arrangement of his snuff-box,
hand-bell, and spectacles, nor to suffer
the glittering of the gold-headed cane
to tempt him to the mortal sin of handling
it,&mdash;and, finally, to pilot himself aright
through his perilous course in and out of
the apartment without striking against the
piles of books, globes, old newspapers, wig-blocks,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_4" title="4"> </a>
tobacco-pipes, and snuff-cannisters,
not to mention certain hidden rocks of rat-traps
and mouldy books beneath the chairs,&mdash;together
with the final reverential bow
at the door, which was to be closed with
cautious gentleness, and the stairs to be
descended as if he were “shod with felt.”&mdash;This
recollection was carried on to his
school-boy years, when at Christmas and
Easter, the ragged poney, the jest of the
school, was dispatched to bring the reluctant
visitor to the Lodge,&mdash;where his pastime
was to sit vis-a-vis to his uncle, without
speaking or moving, till the pair resembled
Don Raymond and the ghost of
Beatrice in the Monk,&mdash;then watching
him as he picked the bones of lean mutton
out of his mess of weak broth, the latter
of which he handed to his nephew with a
needless caution not to “take more than
he liked,”&mdash;then hurried to bed by day-light,
even in winter, to save the expence
of an inch of candle, where he lay awake
and restless from hunger, till his uncle’s
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_5" title="5"> </a>
retiring at eight o’clock gave signal to the
governante of the meagre household to
steal up to him with some fragments of
her own scanty meal, administering between
every mouthful a whispered caution
not to tell his uncle. Then his college
life, passed in an attic in the second
square, uncheered by an invitation to the
country; the gloomy summer wasted in
walking up and down the deserted streets,
as his uncle would not defray the expences
of his journey;&mdash;the only intimation of
his existence, received in quarterly epistles,
containing, with the scanty but punctual
remittance, complaints of the expences of
his education, cautions against extravagance,
and lamentations for the failure of
tenants and the fall of the value of lands.
All these recollections came over him, and
along with them the remembrance of that
last scene, where his dependence on his
uncle was impressed on him by the dying
lips of his father.</p>

<p>“John, I must leave you, my poor boy;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_6" title="6"> </a>
it has pleased God to take your father from
you before he could do for you what
would have made this hour less painful to
him. You must look up, John, to your
uncle for every thing. He has oddities
and infirmities, but you must learn to bear
with them, and with many other things
too, as you will learn too soon. And now,
my poor boy, may He who is the father of
the fatherless look on your desolate state,
and give you favour in the eyes of your
uncle.” As this scene rose to John’s
memory, his eyes filled fast with tears,
which he hastened to wipe away as the
carriage stopt to let him out at his uncle’s
gate.</p>

<p>He alighted, and with a change of linen
in a handkerchief, (his only travelling
equipment), he approached his uncle’s gate.
The lodge was in ruins, and a barefooted
boy from an adjacent cabin ran to lift on
its single hinge what had once been a gate,
but was now a few planks so villainously
put together, that they clattered like a sign
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" title="7"> </a>
in a high wind. The stubborn post of
the gate, yielding at last to the united
strength of John and his barefooted assistant,
grated heavily through the mud and
gravel stones, in which it left a deep and
sloughy furrow, and the entrance lay open.
John, after searching his pocket in vain for
a trifle to reward his assistant, pursued his
way, while the lad, on his return, cleared
the road at a hop step and jump, plunging
through the mud with all the dabbling and
amphibious delight of a duck, and scarce
less proud of his agility than of his “sarving
a gentleman.” As John slowly
trod the miry road which had once been
the approach, he could discover, by the dim
light of an autumnal evening, signs of
increasing desolation since he had last visited
the spot,&mdash;signs that penury had been
aggravated and sharpened into downright
misery. There was not a fence or a hedge
round the domain: an uncemented wall of
loose stones, whose numerous gaps were
filled with furze or thorns, supplied their
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>
place. There was not a tree or shrub on
the lawn; the lawn itself was turned into
pasture-ground, and a few sheep were picking
their scanty food amid the pebble-stones,
thistles, and hard mould, through
which a few blades of grass made their rare
and squalid appearance.</p>

<p>The house itself stood strongly defined
even amid the darkness of the evening sky;
for there were neither wings, or offices, or
shrubbery, or tree, to shade or support it,
and soften its strong harsh outline. John,
after a melancholy gaze at the grass-grown
steps and boarded windows, “addressed
himself” to knock at the door; but
knocker there was none: loose stones,
however, there were in plenty; and John
was making vigorous application to the
door with one of them, till the furious
barking of a mastiff, who threatened at
every bound to break his chain, and whose
yell and growl, accompanied by “eyes
that glow and fangs that grin,” savoured
as much of hunger as of rage, made the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_9" title="9"> </a>
assailant raise the siege on the door, and
betake himself to a well-known passage
that led to the kitchen. A light glimmered
in the window as he approached: he
raised the latch with a doubtful hand; but,
when he saw the party within, he advanced
with the step of a man no longer doubtful
of his welcome.</p>

<p>Round a turf-fire, whose well-replenished
fuel gave testimony to the “master’s”
indisposition, who would probably as soon
have been placed on the fire himself as seen
the whole <em>kish</em> emptied on it once, were
seated the old housekeeper, two or three
<em>followers</em>, (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.&nbsp;e.</i> people who ate, drank, and
lounged about in any kitchen that was
open in the neighbourhood, on an occasion
of grief or joy, all for his honor’s sake, and
for the great rispict they bore the family),
and an old woman, whom John immediately
recognized as the doctress of the neighbourhood,&mdash;a
withered Sybil, who prolonged
her squalid existence by practising on
the fears, the ignorance, and the sufferings
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_10" title="10"> </a>
of beings as miserable as herself. Among
the better sort, to whom she sometimes
had access by the influence of servants, she
tried the effects of some simples, her skill
in which was sometimes productive of success.
Among the lower orders she talked
much of the effects of the “evil eye,” against
which she boasted a counter-spell,
of unfailing efficacy; and while she spoke,
she shook her grizzled locks with such
witch-like eagerness, that she never failed
to communicate to her half-terrified, half-believing
audience, some portion of that
enthusiasm which, amid all her consciousness
of imposture, she herself probably
felt a large share of; still, when the
case at last became desperate, when
credulity itself lost all patience, and
hope and life were departing together,
she urged the miserable patient to confess
“<em>there was something about his
heart</em>;” and when this confession was
extorted from the weariness of pain and
the ignorance of poverty, she nodded and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_11" title="11"> </a>
muttered so mysteriously, as to convey to
the bystanders, that she had had difficulties
to contend with which were invincible by
human power. When there was no pretext,
from indisposition, for her visiting
either “his honor’s” kitchen, or the cottar’s
hut,&mdash;when the stubborn and persevering
convalescence of the whole country threatened
her with starvation,&mdash;she still had a
resource:&mdash;if there were no lives to be
shortened, there were fortunes to be told;&mdash;she
worked “by spells, and by such
daubry as is beyond our element.” No one
twined so well as she the mystic yarn to be
dropt into the lime-kiln pit, on the edge of
which stood the shivering inquirer into futurity,
doubtful whether the answer to her
question of “who holds?” was to be uttered
by the voice of demon or lover.</p>

<p>No one knew so well as she to find
where the four streams met, in which, on
the same portentous season, the chemise
was to be immersed, and then displayed
before the fire, (in the name of one whom
we dare not mention to “ears polite”), to be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_12" title="12"> </a>
turned by the figure of the destined husband
before morning. No one but herself
(she said) knew the hand in which the
comb was to be held, while the other was
employed in conveying the apple to the
mouth,&mdash;while, during the joint operation,
the shadow of the phantom-spouse was to
pass across the mirror before which it was
performed. No one was more skilful or
active in removing every iron implement
from the kitchen where these ceremonies
were usually performed by the credulous
and terrified dupes of her wizardry, lest, instead
of the form of a comely youth exhibiting
a ring on his white finger, an headless
figure should stalk to the rack,
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Anglicè</i>, dresser), take down a long spit,
or, in default of that, snatch a poker from
the fire-side, and mercilessly take measure
with its iron length of the sleeper for a
coffin. No one, in short, knew better how
to torment or terrify her victims into a belief
of that power which may and has reduced
the strongest minds to the level of
the weakest; and under the influence of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_13" title="13"> </a>
which the cultivated sceptic, Lord Lyttleton,
yelled and gnashed and writhed in his
last hours, like the poor girl who, in the belief
of the horrible visitation of the vampire,
shrieked aloud, that her grandfather was
sucking her vital blood while she slept,
and expired under the influence of imaginary
horror. Such was the being to whom
old Melmoth had committed his life, half
from credulity, and (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hibernicè</i> speaking)
<em>more than half</em> from avarice. Among this
groupe John advanced,&mdash;recognising some,&mdash;disliking
more,&mdash;distrusting all. The
old housekeeper received him with cordiality;&mdash;he
was always her “whiteheaded
boy,” she said,&mdash;(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">imprimis</i>, his hair was as
black as jet), and she tried to lift her
withered hand to his head with an action
between a benediction and a caress, till the
difficulty of the attempt forced on her the
conviction that that head was fourteen
inches higher than her reach since she
had last patted it. The men, with the
national deference of the Irish to a person
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" title="14"> </a>
of superior rank, all rose at his approach,
(their stools chattering on the broken flags)
and wished his honor “a thousand years
and long life to the back of that; and would
not his honor take something to keep the
grief out of his heart;” and so saying, five
or six red and bony hands tendered him
glasses of whiskey all at once. All this
time the Sybil sat silent in the ample chimney-corner,
sending redoubled whiffs out of
her pipe. John gently declined the offer of
spirits, received the attentions of the old
housekeeper cordially, looked askance at
the withered crone who occupied the
chimney corner, and then glanced at the
table, which displayed other cheer than he
had been accustomed to see in his “honor’s
time.” There was a wooden dish of potatoes,
which old Melmoth would have considered
enough for a week’s subsistence.
There was the salted salmon, (a luxury unknown
even in London. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vide</i> Miss Edgeworth’s
Tales, “The Absentee).”</p>

<p>There was the <em>slink-veal</em>, flanked with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" title="15"> </a>
tripe; and, finally, there were lobsters and
<em>fried</em> turbot enough to justify what the author
of the tale asserts, “suo periculo,”
that when his great grandfather, the Dean
of Killala, hired servants at the deanery,
they stipulated that they should not be
required to eat turbot or lobster more
than twice a-week. There were also bottles
of Wicklow ale, long and surreptitiously
borrowed from his “honor’s” cellar,
and which now made their first appearance
on the kitchen hearth, and manifested
their impatience of further constraint,
by hissing, spitting, and bouncing
in the face of the fire that provoked its animosity.
But the whiskey (genuine illegitimate
potsheen, smelling strongly of weed
and smoke, and breathing defiance to excisemen)
appeared, the “veritable Amphitryon”
of the feast; every one praised, and
drank as deeply as he praised.</p>

<p>John, as he looked round the circle, and
thought of his dying uncle, was forcibly reminded
of the scene at Don Quixote’s departure,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16"> </a>
where, in spite of the grief caused
by the dissolution of the worthy knight,
we are informed that “nevertheless the
niece eat her victuals, the housekeeper
drank to the repose of his soul, and even
Sancho cherished his little carcase.” After
returning, “as he might,” the courtesies
of the party, John asked how his uncle
was. “As bad as he can be;”&mdash;“Much
better, and many thanks to your honor,”
was uttered in such rapid and discordant
unison by the party, that John turned
from one to the other, not knowing which
or what to believe. “They say his honor
has had a fright,” said a fellow, upwards
of six feet high, approaching by way of
whispering, and then bellowing the sound
six inches above John’s head. “But then his
honor has had <em>a cool</em> since,” said a man who
was quietly swallowing the spirits that
John had refused. At these words the
Sybil who sat in the chimney corner slowly
drew her pipe from her mouth, and turned
towards the party: The oracular movements
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" title="17"> </a>
of a Pythoness on her tripod never
excited more awe, or impressed for the moment
a deeper silence. “It’s not <em>here</em>,”
said she, pressing her withered finger on
her wrinkled forehead, “nor <em>here</em>,&mdash;nor
<em>here</em>;” and she extended her hand to the
foreheads of those who were near her, who
all bowed as if they were receiving a benediction,
but had immediate recourse to the
spirits afterwards, as if to ensure its effects.&mdash;“It’s
all <em>here</em>&mdash;it’s all <em>about the heart</em>;”
and as she spoke she spread and pressed her
fingers on her hollow bosom with a force
of action that thrilled her hearers.&mdash;“It’s all
<em>here</em>,” she added, repeating the action,
(probably excited by the effect she had produced),
and then sunk on her seat, resumed
her pipe, and spoke no more. At this moment
of involuntary awe on the part of
John, and of terrified silence on that of the
rest, an unusual sound was heard in the
house, and the whole company started as
if a musket had been discharged among
them:&mdash;it was the unwonted sound of old
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18"> </a>
Melmoth’s bell. His domestics were so
few, and so constantly near him, that the
sound of his bell startled them as much as
if he had been ringing the knell for his own
interment. “He used always to <em>rap down</em>
for me,” said the old housekeeper, hurrying
out of the kitchen; “he said pulling
the bells wore out the ropes.”</p>

<p>The sound of the bell produced its full
effect. The housekeeper rushed into the
room, followed by a number of women,
(the Irish præficæ), all ready to prescribe
for the dying or weep for the dead,&mdash;all
clapping their hard hands, or wiping their
dry eyes. These hags all surrounded the
bed; and to witness their loud, wild, and
desperate grief, their cries of “Oh! he’s
going, his honor’s going, his honor’s going,”
one would have imagined their lives were
bound up in his, like those of the wives in
the story of Sinbad the Sailor, who were to
be interred alive with their deceased husbands.</p>

<p>Four of them wrung their hands and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19"> </a>
howled round the bed, while one, with all
the adroitness of a Mrs Quickly, felt his
honor’s feet, and “upward and upward,”
and “all was cold as any stone.”</p>

<p>Old Melmoth withdrew his feet from
the grasp of the hag,&mdash;counted with his
keen eye (keen amid the approaching dimness
of death) the number assembled round
his bed,&mdash;raised himself on his sharp elbow,
and pushing away the housekeeper, (who
attempted to settle his nightcap, that had
been shoved on one side in the struggle,
and gave his haggard, dying face, a kind
of grotesque fierceness), bellowed out in
tones that made the company start,&mdash;“What
the devil brought ye all here?”
The question scattered the whole party
for a moment; but rallying instantly, they
communed among themselves in whispers,
and frequently using the sign of the cross,
muttered “The devil,&mdash;Christ save us, the
devil in his mouth the first word he spoke.”
“Aye,” roared the invalid, “and the devil
in my eye the first sight I see.” “Where,&mdash;where?”
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>
cried the terrified housekeeper,
clinging close to the invalid in her terror,
and half-hiding herself in the blanket,
which she snatched without mercy from
his struggling and exposed limbs. “There,
there,” he repeated, (during the battle of
the blanket), pointing to the huddled and
terrified women, who stood aghast at
hearing themselves arointed as the very
demons they came to banish. “Oh! Lord
keep your honor’s head,” said the housekeeper
in a more soothing tone, when her
fright was over; “and sure your honor
knows them all, is’n’t <em>her</em> name,&mdash;and <em>her</em>
name,&mdash;and <em>her</em> name,”&mdash;and she pointed
respectively to each of them, adding their
names, which we shall spare the English
reader the torture of reciting, (as a proof
of our lenity, adding the last only, Cotchleen
O‘Mulligan), “Ye lie, ye b<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>h,”
growled old Melmoth; “their name is
Legion, for they are many,&mdash;turn them
all out of the room,&mdash;turn them all out of
doors,&mdash;if they howl at my death, they
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" title="21"> </a>
shall howl in earnest,&mdash;not for my death,
for they would see me dead and damned
too with dry eyes, but for want of the
whiskey that they would have stolen if
they could have got at it,” (and here old
Melmoth grasped a key which lay under
his pillow, and shook it in vain triumph at
the old housekeeper, who had long possessed
the means of getting at the spirits
unknown to his “honor”), “and for want
of the victuals you have pampered them
with.” “<em>Pampered</em>, oh Ch&mdash;st!” ejaculated
the housekeeper. “Aye, and what
are there so many candles for, all <em>fours</em>,
and the same below I warrant. Ah! you&mdash;you&mdash;worthless,
wasteful old devil.”
“Indeed, your honor, they are all <em>sixes</em>.”
“Sixes,&mdash;and what the devil are you burning
sixes for, d’ye think it’s <em>the wake</em> already?
Ha?” “Oh! not yet, your honor,
not yet,” chorussed the beldams; “but
in God’s good time, your honor knows,”
in a tone that spoke ill suppressed impatience
for the event. “Oh! that your honor
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22"> </a>
would think of making your soul.”
“That’s the first sensible word you have
said,” said the dying man, “fetch me the
prayer-book,&mdash;you’ll find it there under
that old boot-jack,&mdash;blow off the cobwebs;&mdash;it
has not been opened this many a year.”
It was handed to him by the old governante,
on whom he turned a reproaching
eye. “What made you burn sixes in the
kitchen, you extravagant jade? How
many years have you lived in this house?”
“I don’t know, your honor.” “Did you
ever see any extravagance or waste in <ins title="it">it?”</ins>
“Oh never, never, your honor.” “Was
any thing but a farthing candle ever
burned in the kitchen?” “Never, never,
your honor.” “Were not you kept as
tight as hand and head and heart could
keep you, were you not? answer me that.”
“Oh yes, sure, your honor; every <em>sowl</em>
about us knows that,&mdash;every one does your
honor justice, that you kept the closest house
and closest hand in the country,&mdash;your honor
was always a good warrant for it.” “And
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" title="23"> </a>
how dare you unlock my hold before death
has unlocked it,” said the dying miser, shaking
his meagre hand at her. “I smelt meat
in the house,&mdash;I heard voices in the house,&mdash;I
heard the key turn in the door over
and over. Oh that I was up,” he added,
rolling in impatient agony in his bed,
“Oh that I was up, to see the waste and
ruin that is going on. But it would kill
me,” he continued, sinking back on the
bolster, for he never allowed himself a pillow;
“it would kill me,&mdash;the very thought
of it is killing me now.” The women,
discomfited and defeated, after sundry
winks and whispers, were huddling out of
the room, till recalled by the sharp eager
tones of old Melmoth.&mdash;“Where are ye
trooping to now? back to the kitchen to
gormandize and guzzle? Won’t one of
ye stay and listen while there’s a prayer
read for me? Ye may want it one day for
yourselves, ye hags.” Awed by this expostulation
and menace, the train silently
returned, and placed themselves round the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" title="24"> </a>
bed, while the housekeeper, though a Catholic,
asked if his honor would not have
a clergyman to give him <em>the rights</em>, (rites)
of his church. The eyes of the dying
man sparkled with vexation at the proposal.
“What for,&mdash;just to have him expect
a scarf and hat-band at the funeral.
Read the prayers yourself, you old <span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>;
that will save something.” The housekeeper
made the attempt, but soon declined
it, alleging, as her reason, that her
eyes had been watery ever since his honor
took ill. “That’s because you had always
a drop in them,” said the invalid, with a
spiteful sneer, which the contraction of
approaching death stiffened into a hideous
grin.&mdash;“Here,&mdash;is not there one of you
that’s gnashing and howling there, that
can get up a prayer to keep me from it?”
So adjured, one of the women offered her
services; and of her it might truly be said,
as of the “most desartless man of the
watch” in Dogberry’s time, that “her
reading and writing came by nature;” for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_25" title="25"> </a>
she never had been at school, and had never
before seen or opened a Protestant
prayer book in her life; nevertheless, on
she went, and with more emphasis than
good discretion, read nearly through the
service for the “churching of women;”
which in our prayer-books following that
of the burial of the dead, she perhaps
imagined was someway connected with
the state of the invalid.</p>

<p>She read with great solemnity,&mdash;it was a
pity that two interruptions occurred during
the performance, one from old Melmoth,
who, shortly after the commencement of
the prayers, turned towards the old housekeeper,
and said, in a tone scandalously
audible, “Go down and draw the niggers
of the kitchen fire closer, and lock the
door, and let me <em>hear it locked</em>. I can’t
mind any thing till that’s done.” The
other was from John Melmoth gliding into
the room, hearing the inappropriate
words uttered by the ignorant woman,
taking quietly as he knelt beside her the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" title="26"> </a>
prayer-book from her hands, and reading
in a suppressed voice part of that solemn
service which, by the forms of the Church
of England, is intended for the consolation
of the departing.</p>

<p>“That is John’s voice,” said the dying
man; and the little kindness he had ever
shewed this unfortunate lad rushed on his
hard heart at this moment, and touched it.
He saw himself, too, surrounded by heartless
and rapacious menials; and slight as
must have been his dependence on a relative
whom he had always treated as a
stranger, he felt at this hour he was no
stranger, and grasped at his support like
a straw amid his wreck. “John, my good
boy, you are there.&mdash;I kept you far from
me when living, and now you are nearest
me when dying.&mdash;John, <em>read on</em>.” John,
affected deeply by the situation in which
he beheld this <em>poor man</em>, amid all his
wealth, as well as by the solemn request to
impart consolation to his dying moments,
read on;&mdash;but in a short time his voice
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" title="27"> </a>
became indistinct, from the horror with
which he listened to the increasing hiccup
of the patient, which, however, he struggled
with from time to time, to ask the
housekeeper if <em>the niggers were closed</em>.
John, who was a lad of feeling, rose from
his knees in some degree of agitation.
“What, are you leaving me like the
rest?” said old Melmoth, trying to raise
himself in the bed. “No, Sir,” said John;
“but,” observing the altered looks of the
dying man, “I think you want some refreshment,
some support, Sir.” “Aye,
I do, I do, but whom can I trust to get it
for me. <em>They</em>, (and his haggard eye wandered
round the groupe), <em>they</em> would poison
me.” “Trust me, Sir,” said John; “I
will go to the apothecary’s, or whoever
you may employ.” The old man grasped
his hand, drew him close to his bed, cast a
threatening yet fearful eye round the party,
and then whispered in a voice of agonized
constraint, “I want a glass of wine,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" title="28"> </a>
it would keep me alive for some hours,
but there is not one I can trust to get it
for me,&mdash;<em>they’d steal a bottle, and ruin
me</em>.” John was greatly shocked. “Sir,
for God’s sake, let <em>me</em> get a glass of wine
for you.” “Do you know where?” said
the old man, with an expression in his
face John could not understand. “No,
Sir; you know I have been rather a
stranger here, Sir.” “Take this key,” said
old Melmoth, after a violent spasm; “take
this key, there is wine in that closet,&mdash;<em>Madeira</em>.
I always told them there was nothing
there, but they did not believe me,
or I should not have been robbed as I have
been. At one time I said it was whiskey,
and then I fared worse than ever, for they
drank twice as much of it.”</p>

<p>John took the key from his uncle’s
hand; the dying man pressed it as he did
so, and John, interpreting this as a mark
of kindness, returned the pressure. He
was undeceived by the whisper that followed,&mdash;“John,
my lad, don’t drink any
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29"> </a>
of that wine while you are there.” “Good
God!” said John, indignantly throwing
the key on the bed; then, recollecting that
the miserable being before him was no
object of resentment, he gave the promise
required, and entered the closet, which no
foot but that of old Melmoth had entered
for nearly sixty years. He had some difficulty
in finding out the wine, and indeed
staid long enough to justify his uncle’s
suspicions,&mdash;but his mind was agitated,
and his hand unsteady. He could not but
remark his uncle’s extraordinary look, that
had the ghastliness of fear superadded to
that of death, as he gave him permission
to enter his closet. He could not but see
the looks of horror which the women exchanged
as he approached it. And, finally,
when he was in it, his memory was
malicious enough to suggest some faint
traces of a story, too horrible for imagination,
connected with it. He remembered
in one moment most distinctly, that no
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" title="30"> </a>
one but his uncle had ever been known to
enter it for many years.</p>

<p>Before he quitted it, he held up the
dim light, and looked around him with a
mixture of terror and curiosity. There
was a great deal of decayed and useless
lumber, such as might be supposed to be
heaped up to rot in a miser’s closet; but
John’s eyes were in a moment, and as if
by magic, rivetted on a portrait that hung
on the wall, and appeared, even to his untaught
eye, far superior to the tribe of
family pictures that are left to moulder on
the walls of a family mansion. It represented
a man of middle age. There was
nothing remarkable in the costume, or in
the countenance, but <em>the eyes</em>, John felt,
were such as one feels they wish they had
never seen, and feels they can never forget.
Had he been acquainted with the poetry
of Southey, he might have often exclaimed
in his after-life,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Only the eyes had life,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">They gleamed with demon light.”&mdash;<span class="small-caps">Thalaba.</span><br/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" title="31"> </a>From an impulse equally resistless
and painful, he approached the portrait,
held the candle towards it, and could
distinguish the words on the border of
the painting,&mdash;Jno. Melmoth, anno 1646.
John was neither timid by nature, or
nervous by constitution, or superstitious
from habit, yet he continued to gaze in
stupid horror on this singular picture, till,
aroused by his uncle’s cough, he hurried
into his room. The old man swallowed
the wine. He appeared a little revived;
it was long since he had tasted such a cordial,&mdash;his
heart appeared to expand to a
momentary confidence. “John, what did
you see in that room?” “Nothing, Sir.”
“That’s a lie; every one wants to cheat or
to rob me.” “Sir, I don’t want to do
either.” “Well, what did you see that
you&mdash;you took notice of?” “Only a
picture, Sir.” “A picture, Sir!&mdash;the
original is still alive.” John, though
under the impression of his recent feelings,
could not but look incredulous.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" title="32"> </a>
“John,” whispered his uncle;&mdash;“John,
they say I am dying of this and that; and
one says it is for want of nourishment,
and one says it is for want of medicine,&mdash;but,
John,” and his face looked hideously
ghastly, “I am dying of a fright. That
man,” and he extended his meagre arm
toward the closet, as if he was pointing to
a living being; “that man, I have good
reason to know, is alive still.” “How is
that possible, Sir?” said John involuntarily,
“the date on the picture is 1646.”
“You have seen it,&mdash;you have noticed it,”
said his uncle. “Well,”&mdash;he rocked and
nodded on his bolster for a moment, then,
grasping John’s hand with an unutterable
look, he exclaimed, “You will see him
again, he is alive.” Then, sinking back
on his bolster, he fell into a kind of sleep
or stupor, his eyes still open, and fixed on
John.</p>

<p>The house was now perfectly silent, and
John had time and space for reflection.
More thoughts came crowding on him
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33"> </a>
than he wished to welcome, but they
would not be repulsed. He thought of
his uncle’s habits and character, turned the
matter over and over again in his mind,
and he said to himself, “The last man on
earth to be superstitious. He never
thought of any thing but the price of
stocks, and the rate of exchange, and my
college expences, that hung heavier at his
heart than all; and such a man to die of
a fright,&mdash;a ridiculous fright, that a man
living 150 years ago is alive still, and yet&mdash;he
is dying.” John paused, for facts will
confute the most stubborn logician. “With
all his hardness of mind, and of heart, he
is dying of a fright. I heard it in the
kitchen, I have heard it from himself,&mdash;he
could not be deceived. If I had ever
heard he was nervous, or fanciful, or superstitious,
but a character so contrary to all
these impressions;&mdash;a man that, as poor
Butler says, in his Remains of the Antiquarian,
would have “sold Christ over again
for the numerical piece of silver which
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" title="34"> </a>
Judas got for him,”&mdash;such a man to die
of fear! Yet he <em>is</em> dying,” said John,
glancing his fearful eye on the contracted
nostril, the glazed eye, the dropping jaw,
the whole horrible apparatus of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">facies
Hippocratica</i> displayed, and soon to cease
its display.</p>

<p>Old Melmoth at this moment seemed to
be in a deep stupor; his eyes lost that
little expression they had before, and his
hands, that had convulsively been catching
at the blankets, let go their short and
quivering grasp, and lay extended on the
bed like the claws of some bird that had
died of hunger,&mdash;so meagre, so yellow, so
spread. John, unaccustomed to the sight
of death, believed this to be only a sign
that he was going to sleep; and, urged
by an impulse for which he did not attempt
to account to himself, caught up the
miserable light, and once more ventured
into the forbidden room,&mdash;the <em>blue chamber</em>
of the dwelling. The motion roused the
dying man;&mdash;he sat bolt upright in his bed.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_35" title="35"> </a>
This John could not see, for he was now
in the closet; but he heard the groan, or
rather the choaked and guggling rattle of
the throat, that announces the horrible
conflict between muscular and mental convulsion.
He started, turned away; but,
as he turned away, he thought he saw the
eyes of the portrait, on which his own
was fixed, <em>move</em>, and hurried back to his
uncle’s bedside.</p>

<p>Old Melmoth died in the course of that
night, and died as he had lived, in a kind
of avaricious delirium. John could not
have imagined a scene so horrible as his last
hours presented. He cursed and blasphemed
about three half-pence, missing, as he
said, some weeks before, in an account of
change with his groom, about hay to a starved
horse that he kept. Then he grasped
John’s hand, and asked him to give him the
sacrament. “If I send to the clergyman,
he will charge me something for it, which
I cannot pay,&mdash;I cannot. They say I am
rich,&mdash;look at this blanket;&mdash;but I would
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" title="36"> </a>
not mind that, if I could save my soul.”
And, raving, he added, “Indeed, Doctor,
I am a very poor man. I never troubled
a clergyman before, and all I want is, that
you will grant me two trifling requests,
very little matters in your way,&mdash;save my
soul, and (whispering) make interest to
get me a parish coffin,&mdash;I have not enough
left to bury me. I always told every one
I was poor, but the more I told them so,
the less they believed me.”</p>

<p>John, greatly shocked, retired from the
bed-side, and sat down in a distant corner
of the room. The women were again in
the room, which was very dark. Melmoth
was silent from exhaustion, and
there was a death-like pause for some time.
At this moment John saw the door open,
and a figure appear at it, who looked
round the room, and then quietly and deliberately
retired, but not before John had
discovered in his face the living original
of the portrait. His first impulse was to
utter an exclamation of terror, but his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_37" title="37"> </a>
breath felt stopped. He was then rising
to pursue the figure, but a moment’s reflection
checked him. What could be
more absurd, than to be alarmed or amazed
at a resemblance between a living man
and the portrait of a dead one! The likeness
was doubtless strong enough to strike
him even in that darkened room, but it
was doubtless only a likeness; and though
it might be imposing enough to terrify an
old man of gloomy and retired habits, and
with a broken constitution, John resolved
it should not produce the same effect on
him.</p>

<p>But while he was applauding himself
for this resolution, the door opened, and
the figure appeared at it, beckoning and
nodding to him, with a familiarity somewhat
terrifying. John now started up,
determined to pursue it; but the pursuit
was stopped by the weak but shrill cries
of his uncle, who was struggling at once
with the agonies of death and his housekeeper.
The poor woman, anxious for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" title="38"> </a>
her master’s reputation and her own, was
trying to put on him a clean shirt and
nightcap, and Melmoth, who had just
sensation enough to perceive they were
taking something from him, continued exclaiming
feebly, “They are robbing me,&mdash;robbing
me in my last moments,&mdash;robbing
a dying man. John, won’t you assist
me,&mdash;I shall die a beggar; they are
taking my last shirt,&mdash;I shall die a beggar.”&mdash;And
the miser died.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="small-caps">A few</span> days after the funeral, the will
was opened before proper witnesses, and
John was found to be left sole heir to his
uncle’s property, which, though originally
moderate, had, by his grasping habits,
and parsimonious life, become very considerable.</p>

<p>As the attorney who read the will concluded,
he added, “There are some words
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" title="40"> </a>
here, at the corner of the parchment,
which do not appear to be part of the will,
as they are neither in the form of a codicil,
nor is the signature of the testator affixed
to them; but, to the best of my belief,
they are in the hand-writing of the deceased.”
As he spoke he shewed the lines
to Melmoth, who immediately recognized
his uncle’s hand, (that perpendicular and
penurious hand, that seems determined to
make the most of the very paper, thriftily
abridging every word, and leaving scarce
an atom of margin), and read, not without
some emotion, the following words:
“I enjoin my nephew and heir, John
Melmoth, to remove, destroy, or cause to
be destroyed, the portrait inscribed J.
Melmoth, 1646, hanging in my closet. I
also enjoin him to search for a manuscript,
which I think he will find in the third and
lowest left-hand drawer of the mahogany
chest standing under that portrait,&mdash;it is
among some papers of no value, such as
manuscript sermons, and pamphlets on the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" title="41"> </a>
improvement of Ireland, and such stuff;
he will distinguish it by its being tied
round with a black tape, and the paper
being very mouldy and discoloured. He
may read it if he will;&mdash;I think he had
better not. At all events, I adjure him,
if there be any power in the adjuration of
a dying man, to burn it.”</p>

<p>After reading this singular memorandum,
the business of the meeting was again
resumed; and as old Melmoth’s will was
very clear and legally worded, all was soon
settled, the party dispersed, and John
Melmoth was left alone.</p>

<p>We should have mentioned, that his
guardians appointed by the will (for he
was not yet of age) advised him to return
to College, and complete his education as
soon as proper; but John urged the expediency
of paying the respect due to his
uncle’s memory, by remaining a decent
time in the house after his decease. This
was not his real motive. Curiosity, or
something that perhaps deserves a better
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_42" title="42"> </a>
name, the wild and awful pursuit of an
indefinite object, had taken strong hold of
his mind. His guardians (who were men
of respectability and property in the neighbourhood,
and in whose eyes John’s consequence
had risen rapidly since the reading
of the will), pressed him to accept of
a temporary residence in their respective
houses, till his return to Dublin. This
was declined gratefully, but steadily. They
called for their horses, shook hands with
the heir, and rode off&mdash;Melmoth was left
alone.</p>

<p>The remainder of the day was passed
in gloomy and anxious deliberation,&mdash;in
traversing his late uncle’s room,&mdash;approaching
the door of the closet, and then retreating
from it,&mdash;in watching the clouds,
and listening to the wind, as if the gloom
of the one, or the murmurs of the other,
relieved instead of increasing the weight
that pressed on his mind. Finally, towards
evening, he summoned the old woman,
from whom he expected something like an
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_43" title="43"> </a>
explanation of the extraordinary circumstances
he had witnessed since his arrival
at his uncle’s. The old woman, proud of
the summons, readily attended, but she
had very little to tell,&mdash;her communication
was nearly in the following words: (We
spare the reader her endless circumlocutions,
her Irishcisms, and the frequent
interruptions arising from her applications
to her snuff-box, and to the glass
of whiskey punch with which Melmoth
took care to have her supplied). The
old woman deposed, “That his honor
(as she always called the deceased) was
always intent upon the little room inside
his bed-chamber, and reading there, within
the last two years;&mdash;that people, knowing
his honor had money, and thinking it
must be there, had broke into that room,
(in other words, there was a robbery attempted
there), but finding nothing but
some papers, they had retired;&mdash;that he
was so frightened, he had bricked up the
window; but <em>she thought there was more
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" title="44"> </a>
in it than that</em>, for when his honor missed
but a half-penny, he would make the
house ring about it, but that, when the
closet was bricked up, he never said a
word;&mdash;that afterwards his honor used to
lock himself up in his own room, and
though he was never fond of reading, was
always found, when his dinner was brought
him, hanging over a paper, which he hid
the moment any one came into the room,
and once there was a great bustle about a
picture that he tried to conceal;&mdash;that
knowing there was an <em>odd story in the
family</em>, she did her best to come at it, and
even went to Biddy Brannigan’s, (the medical
Sybil before mentioned), to find out
the rights of it; but Biddy only shook
her head, filled her pipe, uttered some
words she did not understand, and smoked
on;&mdash;that it was but two evenings before
his honor <em>was struck</em>, (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.&nbsp;e.</i> took ill), she
was standing at the door of the court,
(which had once been surrounded by stables,
pigeon-house, and all the usual etceteras
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_45" title="45"> </a>
of a gentleman’s residence, but
now presented only a ruinous range of
dismantled out-offices, thatched with thistles,
and tenanted by pigs), when his honor
called to her to lock the door, (his honor
was always <em>keen</em> about locking the doors
early); she was hastening to do so, when
he snatched the key from her, swearing at
her, (for he was always very keen about
locking the doors, though the locks were
so bad, and the keys so rusty, that it was
always like <em>the cry of the dead</em> in the
house when the keys were turned);&mdash;that
she stood aside for a minute, seeing he was
angry, and gave him the key, when she
heard him utter a scream, and saw him
fall across the door-way;&mdash;that she hurried
to raise him, <em>hoping</em> it was a fit;&mdash;that
she found him stiff and stretched out, and
called for help to lift him up;&mdash;that then
people came from the kitchen to assist;&mdash;that
she was so bewildered and terrified,
she hardly knew what was done or said;
but with all her terror remembered,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_46" title="46"> </a>
that as they raised him up, the first sign
of life he gave was lifting up his arm, and
pointing it towards the court, and at that
moment she saw the figure of a tall man
cross the court, and go out of the court,
she knew not where or how, for the outer
gate was locked, and had not been opened
for years, and they were all gathered round
his honor at the other door;&mdash;she saw the
figure,&mdash;she saw the shadow on the wall,&mdash;she
saw him walk slowly through the
court, and in her terror cried, “Stop him,”
but nobody minded her, all being busy
about her master; and when he was
brought to his room, nobody thought but
of getting him to himself again. And
further she could not tell. His honor
(young Melmoth) knew as much as she,&mdash;he
had witnessed his last illness, had heard
his last words, he saw him die,&mdash;how could
she know more than his honor.”</p>

<p>“True,” said Melmoth, “I certainly
saw him die; but&mdash;you say <em>there was an
odd story in the family</em>, do you know any
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" title="47"> </a>
thing about it?” “Not a word, it was long
before my time, as old as I am.” “Certainly
it must have been so; but, was my
uncle ever superstitious, fanciful?”&mdash;and
Melmoth was compelled to use many synonymous
expressions, before he could
make himself understood. When he did,
the answer was plain and decisive, “No,
never, never. When his honor sat in the
kitchen in winter, to save a fire in his own
room, he could never bear the talk of the
old women that came in to light their
pipes <em>betimes</em>, (from time to time). He
used to shew such impatience of their
superstitious nonsense, that they were fain
to smoke them in silence, without the
consolatory accompaniment of one whisper
about a child that the evil eye had looked
on, or another, that though apparently a
mewling, peevish, crippled brat all day,
went regularly out at night to dance with
the <em>good people</em> on the top of a neighbouring
mountain, summoned thereto by the
sound of a bag-pipe, which was unfailingly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_48" title="48"> </a>
heard at the cabin door every night.”
Melmoth’s thoughts began to take somewhat
of a darker hue at this account. If
his uncle was not superstitious, might he
not have been guilty, and might not his
strange and sudden death, and even the
terrible visitation that preceded it, have
been owing to some wrong that his rapacity
had done the widow and the fatherless.
He questioned the old woman indirectly
and cautiously on the subject,&mdash;her
answer completely justified the deceased.
“He was a man,” she said, “of
a hard hand, and a hard heart, but he was
as jealous of another’s right as of his own.
He would have starved all the world, but
he would not have wronged it of a farthing.”</p>

<p>Melmoth’s last resource was to send for
Biddy Brannigan, who was still in the
house, and from whom he at least hoped
to hear the odd story that the old woman
confessed was in the family. She came,
and, on her introduction to Melmoth, it
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" title="49"> </a>
was curious to observe the mingled look
of servility and command, the result of
the habits of her life, which was alternately
one of abject mendicity, and of arrogant
but clever imposture. When she
first appeared, she stood at the door, awed
and curtseying in the presence, and muttering
sounds which, possibly intended for
blessings, had, from the harsh tone and
witch-like look of the speaker, every appearance
of malediction; but when interrogated
on the subject of the story, she
rose at once into consequence,&mdash;her figure
seemed frightfully dilated, like that of
Virgil’s Alecto, who exchanges in a moment
the appearance of a feeble old woman
for that of a menacing fury. She walked
deliberately across the room, seated, or rather
squatted herself on the hearth-stone
like a hare in her form, spread her bony
and withered hands towards the blaze, and
rocked for a considerable time in silence
before she commenced her tale. When
she had finished it, Melmoth remained in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" title="50"> </a>
astonishment at the state of mind to which
the late singular circumstances had reduced
him,&mdash;at finding himself listening with
varying and increasing emotions of interest,
curiosity, and terror, to a tale so wild,
so improbable, nay, so actually incredible,
that he at least blushed for the folly he
could not conquer. The result of these
impressions was, a resolution to visit the
closet, and examine the manuscript that
very night.</p>

<p>This resolution he found it impossible
to execute immediately, for, on inquiring
for lights, the gouvernante confessed the
very last had been burnt at <em>his honor’s</em>
wake; and a bare-footed boy was charged
to run for life and death to the neighbouring
village for candles; and if you could
<em>borry</em> a couple of candlesticks, added the
housekeeper. “Are there no candlesticks
in the house?” said Melmoth. “There
are, honey, plinty, but it’s no time to be
opening the old chest, for the plated ones,
in regard of their being at the bottom of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" title="51"> </a>
it, and the brass ones that’s <em>in it</em> (in the
house), one of them has no socket, and the
other has no bottom.” “And how did
you make shift yourself,” said Melmoth.
“I stuck it in a potatoe,” quoth the housekeeper.
So the <em>gossoon</em> ran for life and
death, and Melmoth, towards the close of
the evening, was left alone to meditate.</p>

<p>It was an evening apt for meditation,
and Melmoth had his fill of it before the
messenger returned. The weather was
cold and gloomy; heavy clouds betokened
a long and dreary continuance of autumnal
rains; cloud after cloud came sweeping on
like the dark banners of an approaching
host, whose march is for desolation. As
Melmoth leaned against the window, whose
dismantled frame, and pieced and shattered
panes, shook with every gust of wind,
his eye encountered nothing but that most
cheerless of all prospects, a miser’s garden,&mdash;walls
broken down, grass-grown walks
whose grass was not even green, dwarfish,
doddered, leafless trees, and a luxuriant
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" title="52"> </a>
crop of nettles and weeds rearing their
unlovely heads where there had once been
flowers, all waving and bending in capricious
and unsightly forms, as the wind
sighed over them. It was the verdure of
the church yard, the garden of death. He
turned for relief to the room, but no relief
was there,&mdash;the wainscotting dark with
dirt, and in many places cracked and
starting from the walls,&mdash;the rusty grate,
so long unconscious of a fire, that nothing
but a sullen smoke could be coaxed to
issue from between its dingy bars,&mdash;the
crazy chairs, their torn bottoms of rush
drooping inwards, and the great leathern
seat displaying the stuffing round the
worn edges, while the nails, though they
kept their places, had failed to keep the
covering they once fastened,&mdash;the chimney-piece,
which, tarnished more by time than
by smoke, displayed for its garniture half
a pair of snuffers, a tattered almanack of
1750, a time-keeper dumb for want of repair,
and a rusty fowling-piece without a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" title="53"> </a>
lock.&mdash;No wonder the spectacle of desolation
drove Melmoth back to his own
thoughts, restless and uncomfortable as
they were. He recapitulated the Sybil’s
story word by word, with the air of a man
who is cross-examining an evidence, and
trying to make him contradict himself.</p>

<p>“The first of the Melmoths, she says, who
settled in Ireland, was an officer in Cromwell’s
army, who obtained a grant of lands,
the confiscated property of an Irish family
attached to the royal cause. The elder brother
of this man was one who had travelled
abroad, and resided so long on the Continent,
that his family had lost all recollection
of him. Their memory was not stimulated
by their affection, for there were
strange reports concerning the traveller.
He was said to be (like the “damned magician,
great Glendower,”) “a gentleman
profited in strange concealments.”</p>

<p>It must be remembered, that at this
period, and even to a later, the belief in
astrology and witchcraft was very general.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" title="54"> </a>
Even so late as the reign of Charles&nbsp;II.
Dryden calculated the nativity of his son
Charles, the ridiculous books of Glanville
were in general circulation, and Delrio
and Wierus were so popular, that even a
dramatic writer (Shadwell) quoted copiously
from them, in the notes subjoined to
his curious comedy of the Lancashire
witches. It was said, that during the
life-time of Melmoth, the traveller paid
him a visit; and though he must have
then been considerably advanced in life,
to the astonishment of his family, he did
not betray the slightest trace of being a
year older than when they last beheld him.
His visit was short, he said nothing of the
past or the future, nor did his family question
him. It was said that they did not
feel themselves perfectly at ease in his presence.
On his departure he left them his
picture, (the same which Melmoth saw in
the closet, bearing date 1646), and they
saw him no more. Some years after, a
person arrived from England, directed to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" title="55"> </a>
Melmoth’s house, in pursuit of the traveller,
and exhibiting the most marvellous
and unappeasable solicitude to obtain some
intelligence of him. The family could
give him none, and after some days of
restless inquiry and agitation, he departed,
leaving behind him, either through negligence
or intention, a manuscript, containing
an extraordinary account of the circumstances
under which he had met John
Melmoth the Traveller (as he was called).</p>

<p>The manuscript and portrait were both
preserved, and of the original a report
spread that he was still alive, and had been
frequently seen in Ireland even to the present
century,&mdash;but that he was never known
to appear but on the approaching death of
one of the family, nor even then, unless
when the evil passions or habits of the individual
had cast a shade of gloomy and
fearful interest over their dying hour.</p>

<p>It was therefore judged no favourable
augury for the spiritual destination of the
last Melmoth, that this extraordinary person
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" title="56"> </a>
had visited, or been imagined to visit,
the house previous to his decease.”</p>

<p>Such was the account given by Biddy
Brannigan, to which she added her own
solemnly-attested belief, that John Melmoth
the Traveller was still without a hair
on his head changed, or a muscle in his
frame contracted;&mdash;that she had seen those
that had seen him, and would confirm
their evidence by oath if necessary;&mdash;that
he was never heard to speak, seen to partake
of food, or known to enter any dwelling
but that of his family;&mdash;and, finally,
that she herself believed that his late appearance
boded no good either to the living
or the dead.</p>

<p>John was still musing on these things
when the lights were procured, and, disregarding
the pallid countenances and monitory
whispers of the attendants, he resolutely
entered the closet, shut the door,
and proceeded to search for the manuscript.
It was soon found, for the directions of
old Melmoth were forcibly written, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" title="57"> </a>
strongly remembered. The manuscript,
old, tattered, and discoloured, was taken
from the very drawer in which it was
mentioned to be laid. Melmoth’s hands
felt as cold as those of his dead uncle,
when he drew the blotted pages from their
nook. He sat down to read,&mdash;there was
a dead silence through the house. Melmoth
looked wistfully at the candles, snuffed
them, and still thought they looked
dim, (perchance he thought they burned
blue, but such thought he kept to himself.)
Certain it is, he often changed his posture,
and would have changed his chair, had
there been more than one in the apartment.</p>

<p>He sunk for a few moments into a fit of
gloomy abstraction, till the sound of the
clock striking twelve made him start,&mdash;it
was the only sound he had heard for some
hours, and the sounds produced by inanimate
things, while all living beings around
are as dead, have at such an hour an effect
indescribably awful. John looked at his
manuscript with some reluctance, opened
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_58" title="58"> </a>
it, paused over the first lines, and as the
wind sighed round the desolate apartment,
and the rain pattered with a mournful
sound against the dismantled window,
wished<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>what did he wish for?&mdash;he
wished the sound of the wind less dismal,
and the dash of the rain less monotonous.<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>He
may be forgiven, it was past midnight,
and there was not a human being
awake but himself within ten miles when
he began to read.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="small-caps">The</span> manuscript was discoloured, obliterated,
and mutilated beyond any that had
ever before exercised the patience of a
reader. Michaelis himself, scrutinizing
into the pretended autograph of St Mark
at Venice, never had a harder time of it.&mdash;Melmoth
could make out only a sentence
here and there. The writer, it appeared,
was an Englishman of the name of Stanton,
who had travelled abroad shortly after
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_60" title="60"> </a>
the Restoration. Travelling was not then
attended with the facilities which modern
improvement has introduced, and scholars
and literati, the intelligent, the idle, and
the curious, wandered over the Continent
for years, like <em>Tom Coryat</em>, though they
had the modesty, on their return, to entitle
the result of their multiplied observations
and labours only “crudities.”</p>

<p>Stanton, about the year 1676, was in
Spain; he was, like most of the travellers
of that age, a man of literature, intelligence,
and curiosity, but ignorant of the
language of the country, and fighting his
way at times from convent to convent, in
quest of what was called “Hospitality,”
that is, obtaining board and lodging on
the condition of holding a debate in Latin,
on some point theological or metaphysical,
with any monk who would become the
champion of the strife. Now, as the theology
was Catholic, and the metaphysics
Aristotelian, Stanton sometimes wished
himself at the miserable Posada from
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_61" title="61"> </a>
whose filth and famine he had been fighting
his escape; but though his reverend
antagonists always denounced his creed,
and comforted themselves, even in defeat,
with the assurance that he must be damned,
on the double score of his being a heretic
and an Englishman, they were obliged
to confess that his Latin was good,
and his logic unanswerable; and he was
allowed, in most cases, to sup and sleep
in peace. This was not doomed to be his
fate on the night of the 17th August
1677, when he found himself in the plains
of Valencia, deserted by a cowardly guide,
who had been terrified by the sight of a
cross erected as a memorial of a murder,
had slipped off his mule unperceived,
crossing himself every step he took on his
retreat from the heretic, and left Stanton
amid the terrors of an approaching storm,
and the dangers of an unknown country.
The sublime and yet softened beauty of
the scenery around, had filled the soul of
Stanton with delight, and he enjoyed that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" title="62"> </a>
delight as Englishmen generally do, silently.</p>

<p>The magnificent remains of two dynasties
that had passed away, the ruins of
Roman palaces, and of Moorish fortresses,
were around and above him;&mdash;the dark
and heavy thunder-clouds that advanced
slowly, seemed like the shrouds of these
spectres of departed greatness; they approached,
but did not yet overwhelm or
conceal them, as if nature herself was for
once awed by the power of man; and far
below, the lovely valley of Valencia blushed
and burned in all the glory of sunset,
like a bride receiving the last glowing kiss
of the bridegroom before the approach of
night. Stanton gazed around. The difference
between the architecture of the
Roman and Moorish ruins struck him.
Among the former are the remains of a
theatre, and something like a public place;
the latter present only the remains of fortresses,
embattled, castellated, and fortified
from top to bottom,&mdash;not a loop-hole for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" title="63"> </a>
pleasure to get in by,&mdash;the loop-holes were
only for arrows; all denoted military power
and despotic subjugation <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a l’outrance</i>.
The contrast might have pleased a philosopher,
and he might have indulged in
the reflection, that though the ancient
Greeks and Romans were savages, (as Dr
Johnson says all people who want a press
must be, and he says truly), yet they were
wonderful savages for their time, for they
alone have left <em>traces of their taste for
pleasure</em> in the countries they conquered,
in their superb theatres, temples, (which
were also dedicated to pleasure one way or
another), and baths, while other conquering
bands of savages never left any thing
behind them but traces of their rage for
power. So thought Stanton, as he still
saw strongly defined, though darkened by
the darkening clouds, the huge skeleton
of a Roman amphitheatre, its arched and
gigantic colonnades now admitting a gleam
of light, and now commingling with the
purple thunder-cloud; and now the solid
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_64" title="64"> </a>
and heavy mass of a Moorish fortress, no
light playing between its impermeable
walls,&mdash;the image of power, dark, isolated,
impenetrable. Stanton forgot his cowardly
guide, his loneliness, his danger amid
an approaching storm and an inhospitable
country, where his name and country
would shut every door against him, and
every peal of thunder would be supposed
justified by the daring intrusion of a heretic
in the dwelling of an <em>old Christian</em>, as
the Spanish Catholics absurdly term themselves,
to mark the distinction between
them and the baptised Moors.&mdash;All this
was forgot in contemplating the glorious
and awful scenery before him,&mdash;light
struggling with darkness,&mdash;and darkness
menacing a light still more terrible, and
announcing its menace in the blue and
livid mass of cloud that hovered like a destroying
angel in the air, its arrows aimed,
but their direction awfully indefinite. But
he ceased to forget these local and petty
dangers, as the sublimity of romance
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_65" title="65"> </a>
would term them, when he saw the first
flash of the lightning, broad and red as
the banners of an insulting army whose
motto is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Væ victis</i>, shatter to atoms the
remains of a Roman tower;&mdash;the rifted
stones rolled down the hill, and fell at the
feet of Stanton. He stood appalled, and,
awaiting his summons from the Power in
whose eye pyramids, palaces, and the
worms whose toil has formed them, and
the worms who toil out their existence
under their shadow or their pressure, are
perhaps all alike contemptible, he stood
collected, and for a moment felt that defiance
of danger which danger itself excites,
and we love to encounter it as a
physical enemy, to bid it “do its worst,”
and feel that its worst will perhaps be ultimately
its best for us. He stood and saw
another flash dart its bright, brief, and
malignant glance over the ruins of ancient
power, and the luxuriance of recent fertility.
Singular contrast! The relics of art
for ever decaying,&mdash;the productions of nature
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_66" title="66"> </a>
for ever renewed.&mdash;(Alas! for what purpose
are they renewed, better than to mock
at the perishable monuments which men try
in vain to rival them by). The pyramids
themselves must perish, but the grass that
grows between their disjointed stones will
be renewed from year to year. Stanton
was thinking thus, when all power of
thought was suspended, by seeing two
persons bearing between them the body of
a young, and apparently very lovely girl,
who had been struck dead by the lightning.
Stanton approached, and heard the
voices of the bearers repeating, “There is
none who will mourn for her!” “There
is none who will mourn for her!” said
other voices, as two more bore in their
arms the blasted and blackened figure of
what had once been a man, comely and
graceful;&mdash;“there is not <em>one</em> to mourn for
her now!” They were lovers, and he had
been consumed by the flash that had destroyed
her, while in the act of endeavouring
to defend her. As they were about
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_67" title="67"> </a>
to remove the bodies, a person approached
with a calmness of step and demeanour,
as if he were alone unconscious of danger,
and incapable of fear; and after looking
on them for some time, burst into a laugh
so loud, wild, and protracted, that the
peasants, starting with as much horror at
the sound as at that of the storm, hurried
away, bearing the corse with them. Even
Stanton’s fears were subdued by his astonishment,
and, turning to the stranger,
who remained standing on the same spot,
he asked the reason of such an outrage on
humanity. The stranger, slowly turning
round, and disclosing a countenance which<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>
(Here
the manuscript was illegible
for a few lines), said in English<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span> (A
long hiatus followed here, and the next
passage that was legible, though it proved
to be a continuation of the narrative, was
but a fragment). * *
* * * *</p>

<p>The terrors of the night rendered Stanton
a sturdy and unappeasable applicant;
and the shrill voice of the old woman, repeating,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_68" title="68"> </a>
“no heretic&mdash;no English&mdash;Mother
of God protect us&mdash;avaunt Satan!”&mdash;combined
with the clatter of the wooden
casement (peculiar to the houses in Valentia)
which she opened to discharge her
volley of anathematization, and shut again
as the lightning glanced through the aperture,
were unable to repel his importunate
request for admittance, in a night whose
terrors ought to soften all the miserable
petty local passions into one awful feeling
of fear for the Power who caused it, and
compassion for those who were exposed to
it.&mdash;But Stanton felt there was something
more than national bigotry in the exclamations
of the old woman; there was a
peculiar and personal horror of the English.&mdash;And
he was right; but this did
not diminish the eagerness of his *
* * * *
The house was handsome and spacious,
but the melancholy appearance of desertion
* * *
* * * *
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_69" title="69"> </a>
* * * *
&mdash;The benches were by the wall, but there
were none to sit there; the tables were
spread in what had been the hall, but it
seemed as if none had gathered round
them for many years;&mdash;the clock struck
audibly, there was no voice of mirth or of
occupation to drown its sound; time told
his awful lesson to silence alone;&mdash;the
hearths were black with fuel long since
consumed;&mdash;the family portraits looked as
if they were the only tenants of the mansion;
they seemed to say, from their mouldering
frames, “there are none to gaze on
us;” and the echo of the steps of Stanton
and his feeble guide, was the only sound
audible between the peals of thunder that
rolled still awfully, but more distantly,&mdash;every
peal like the exhausted murmurs of
a spent heart. As they passed on, a shriek
was heard. Stanton paused, and fearful
images of the dangers to which travellers
on the Continent are exposed in deserted
and remote habitations, came into his
mind. “Don’t heed it,” said the old woman,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_70" title="70"> </a>
lighting him on with a miserable
lamp;&mdash;“it is only he * * *
* * * * * * * *
The old woman having now satisfied herself,
by ocular demonstration, that her
English guest, even if he was the devil,
had neither horn, hoof, or tail, that he
could bear the sign of the cross without
changing his form, and that, when he
spoke, not a puff of sulphur came out of
his mouth, began to take courage, and at
length commenced her story, which,
weary and comfortless as Stanton was, *
* * * *</p>

<p>“Every obstacle was now removed;
parents and relations at last gave up all opposition,
and the young pair were united.
Never was there a lovelier,&mdash;they seemed
like angels who had only anticipated by a
few years their celestial and eternal union.
The marriage was solemnized with much
pomp, and a few days after there was a
feast in that very wainscotted chamber
which you paused to remark was so gloomy.
It was that night hung with rich tapestry,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_71" title="71"> </a>
representing the exploits of the Cid, particularly
that of his burning a few Moors
who refused to renounce their accursed
religion. They were represented beautifully
tortured, writhing and howling, and
“Mahomet! Mahomet!” issuing out of
their mouths, as they called on him in
their burning agonies;&mdash;you could almost
hear them scream. At the upper end of
the room, under a splendid estrade, over
which was an image of the blessed Virgin,
sat Donna Isabella de Cardoza, mother to
the bride, and near her Donna Ines, the
bride, on rich almohadas; the bridegroom
sat opposite to her; and though they
never spoke to each other, their eyes,
slowly raised, but suddenly withdrawn,
(those eyes that blushed), told to each
other the delicious secret of their happiness.
Don Pedro de Cardoza had assembled
a large party in honour of his daughter’s
nuptials; among them was an Englishman
of the name of <em>Melmoth</em>, a traveller;
no one knew who had brought him
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_72" title="72"> </a>
there. He sat silent like the rest, while
the iced waters and the sugared wafers
were presented to the company. The
night was intensely hot, and the moon
glowed like a sun over the ruins of Saguntum;
the embroidered blinds flapped
heavily, as if the wind made an effort to
raise them in vain, and then desisted.</p>

<p>(Another defect in the manuscript occurred
here, but it was soon supplied).</p>

<p class="center">* &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; *</p>

<p>“The company were dispersed through
various alleys of the garden; the bridegroom
and bride wandered through one where
the delicious perfume of the orange trees
mingled itself with that of the myrtles in
blow. On their return to the hall, both
of them asked, Had the company heard
the exquisite sounds that floated through
the garden just before they quitted it?
No one had heard them. They expressed
their surprise. The Englishman had never
quitted the hall; it was said he smiled
with a most particular and extraordinary
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_73" title="73"> </a>
expression as the remark was made. His
silence had been noticed before, but it was
ascribed to his ignorance of the Spanish
language, an ignorance that Spaniards are
not anxious either to expose or remove by
speaking to a stranger. The subject of
the music was not again reverted to till
the guests were seated at supper, when
Donna Ines and her young husband, exchanging
a smile of delighted surprise, exclaimed
they heard the same delicious
sounds floating round them. The guests
listened, but no one else could hear it;&mdash;every
one felt there was something extraordinary
in this. Hush! was uttered by
every voice almost at the same moment.
A dead silence followed,&mdash;you would think,
from their intent looks, that they listened
with their very eyes. This deep silence,
contrasted with the splendour of the feast,
and the light effused from torches held by
the domestics, produced a singular effect,&mdash;it
seemed for some moments like an assembly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" title="74"> </a>
of the dead. The silence was interrupted,
though the cause of wonder
had not ceased, by the entrance of Father
Olavida, the Confessor of Donna Isabella,
who had been called away previous to the
feast, to administer extreme unction to a
dying man in the neighbourhood. He
was a priest of uncommon sanctity, beloved
in the family, and respected in the
neighbourhood, where he had displayed
uncommon taste and talents for exorcism;&mdash;in
fact, this was the good Father’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">forte</i>,
and he piqued himself on it accordingly.
The devil never fell into worse hands than
Father Olavida’s, for when he was so contumacious
as to resist Latin, and even the
first verses of the Gospel of St John in
Greek, which the good Father never had
recourse to but in cases of extreme stubbornness
and difficulty,&mdash;(here Stanton recollected
the English story of the <cite>Boy of
Bilson</cite>, and blushed even in Spain for his
countrymen),&mdash;then he always applied to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" title="75"> </a>
the Inquisition; and if the devils were
ever so obstinate before, they were always
seen to fly out of the possessed, just as, in
the midst of their cries, (no doubt of blasphemy),
they were tied to the stake. Some
held out even till the flames surrounded
them; but even the most stubborn must
have been dislodged when the operation
was over, for the devil himself could no
longer tenant a crisp and glutinous lump
of cinders. Thus Father Olavida’s fame
spread far and wide, and the Cardoza
family had made uncommon interest to
procure him for a Confessor, and happily
succeeded. The ceremony he had just
been performing, had cast a shade over
the good Father’s countenance, but it dispersed
as he mingled among the guests,
and was introduced to them. Room was
soon made for him, and he happened accidentally
to be seated opposite the Englishman.
As the wine was presented to
him, Father Olavida, (who, as I observed,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_76" title="76"> </a>
was a man of singular sanctity), prepared
to utter a short internal prayer. He hesitated,&mdash;trembled,&mdash;desisted;
and, putting
down the wine, wiped the drops from his
forehead with the sleeve of his habit.
Donna Isabella gave a sign to a domestic,
and other wine of a higher quality was
offered to him. His lips moved, as if in
the effort to pronounce a benediction on it
and the company, but the effort again
failed; and the change in his countenance
was so extraordinary, that it was perceived
by all the guests. He felt the sensation
that his extraordinary appearance excited,
and attempted to remove it by again endeavouring
to lift the cup to his lips. So
strong was the anxiety with which the
company watched him, that the only sound
heard in that spacious and crowded hall,
was the rustling of his habit, as he attempted
to lift the cup to his lips once
more&mdash;in vain. The guests sat in astonished
silence. Father Olavida alone remained
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_77" title="77"> </a>
standing; but at that moment the
Englishman rose, and appeared determined
to fix Olavida’s regards by a gaze like
that of fascination. Olavida rocked, reeled,
grasped the arm of a page, and at last,
closing his eyes for a moment, as if to
escape the horrible fascination of that unearthly
glare, (the Englishman’s eyes were
observed by all the guests, from the moment
of his entrance, to effuse a most
fearful and preternatural lustre), exclaimed,
“Who is among us?&mdash;Who?&mdash;I cannot
utter a blessing while he is here. I
cannot feel one. Where he treads, the
earth is parched!&mdash;Where he breathes, the
air is fire!&mdash;Where he feeds, the food is
poison!&mdash;Where he turns, his glance is
lightning!&mdash;<em>Who is among us?</em>&mdash;<em>Who?</em>”
repeated the priest in the agony of adjuration,
while his cowl fallen back, his few
thin hairs around the scalp instinct and
alive with terrible emotion, his outspread
arms protruded from the sleeves of his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_78" title="78"> </a>
habit, and extended towards the awful
stranger, suggested the idea of an inspired
being in the dreadful rapture of prophetic
denunciation. He stood&mdash;still stood, and
the Englishman stood calmly opposite to
him. There was an agitated irregularity
in the attitudes of those around them,
which contrasted strongly the fixed and
stern postures of those two, who remained
gazing silently at each other. “Who
knows him?” exclaimed Olavida, starting
apparently from a trance; “who knows
him? who brought him here?”</p>

<p>The guests severally disclaimed all
knowledge of the Englishman, and each
asked the other in whispers, “who <em>had</em>
brought him there?” Father Olavida
then pointed his arm to each of the company,
and asked each individually, “Do
you know him?” “No! no! no!”
was uttered with vehement emphasis by
every individual. “But I know him,”
said Olavida, “by these cold drops!” and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_79" title="79"> </a>
he wiped them off;&mdash;“by these convulsed
joints!” and he attempted to sign the
cross, but could not. He raised his voice,
and evidently speaking with increased difficulty,&mdash;“By
this bread and wine, which
the faithful receive as the body and blood
of Christ, but which <em>his</em> presence converts
into matter as viperous as the suicide foam
of the dying Judas,&mdash;by all these&mdash;I know
him, and command him to be gone!&mdash;He
is&mdash;he is<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>” and he bent forwards as he
spoke, and gazed on the Englishman with
an expression which the mixture of rage,
hatred, and fear, rendered terrible. All
the guests rose at these words,&mdash;the whole
company now presented two singular
groupes, that of the amazed guests all
collected together, and repeating, “Who,
what is he?” and that of the Englishman,
who stood unmoved, and Olavida, who
dropped dead in the attitude of pointing
to him. * * * * * *
* * * * * *</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" title="80"> </a>The body was removed into another
room, and the departure of the Englishman
was not noticed till the company returned
to the hall. They sat late together,
conversing on this extraordinary circumstance,
and finally agreed to remain in
the house, lest the evil spirit (for they believed
the Englishman no better) should
take certain liberties with the corse by no
means agreeable to a Catholic, particularly
as he had manifestly died without the benefit
of the last sacraments. Just as this
laudable resolution was formed, they were
roused by cries of horror and agony from
the bridal-chamber, where the young pair
had retired.</p>

<p>They hurried to the door, but the father
was first. They burst it open, and found
the bride a corse in the arms of her husband.
* * *
* * * *
He never recovered his reason; the family
deserted the mansion rendered terrible by
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_81" title="81"> </a>
so many misfortunes. One apartment is
still tenanted by the unhappy maniac; his
were the cries you heard as you traversed
the deserted rooms. He is for the most
part silent during the day, but at midnight
he always exclaims, in a voice frightfully
piercing, and hardly human, “They
are coming! they are coming!” and relapses
into profound silence.</p>

<p>The funeral of Father Olavida was attended
by an extraordinary circumstance.
He was interred in a neighbouring convent;
and the reputation of his sanctity,
joined to the interest caused by his extraordinary
death, collected vast numbers at
the ceremony. His funeral sermon was
preached by a monk of distinguished eloquence,
appointed for the purpose. To
render the effect of his discourse more
powerful, the corse, extended on a bier,
with its face uncovered, was placed in the
aisle. The monk took his text from one
of the prophets,&mdash;“Death is gone up into
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" title="82"> </a>
our palaces.” He expatiated on mortality,
whose approach, whether abrupt or
lingering, is alike awful to man.&mdash;He
spoke of the vicissitudes of empires with
much eloquence and learning, but his audience
were not observed to be much affected.&mdash;He
cited various passages from the
lives of the saints, descriptive of the glories
of martyrdom, and the heroism of
those who had bled and blazed for Christ
and his blessed mother, but they appeared
still waiting for something to touch them
more deeply. When he inveighed against
the tyrants under whose bloody persecutions
those holy men suffered, his hearers
were roused for a moment, for it is always
easier to excite a passion than a moral feeling.
But when he spoke of the dead, and
pointed with emphatic gesture to the corse,
as it lay before them cold and motionless,
every eye was fixed, and every ear became
attentive. Even the lovers, who,
under pretence of dipping their fingers
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_83" title="83"> </a>
into the holy water, were contriving to
exchange amorous billets, forbore for one
moment this interesting intercourse, to
listen to the preacher. He dwelt with
much energy on the virtues of the deceased,
whom he declared to be a particular
favourite of the Virgin; and enumerating
the various losses that would be caused by
his departure to the community to which
he belonged, to society, and to religion at
large; he at last worked up himself to a
vehement expostulation with the Deity on
the occasion. “Why hast thou,” he exclaimed,
“why hast thou, Oh God! thus
dealt with us? Why hast thou snatched
from our sight this glorious saint, whose
merits, if properly applied, doubtless would
have been sufficient to atone for the apostacy
of St Peter, the opposition of St
Paul, (previous to his conversion), and
even the treachery of Judas himself?
Why hast thou, Oh God! snatched him
from us?”&mdash;and a deep and hollow voice
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" title="84"> </a>
from among the congregation <ins title="answersed">answered</ins>,&mdash;“Because
he deserved his fate.” The
murmurs of approbation with which the
congregation honoured this apostrophe,
half-drowned this extraordinary interruption;
and though there was some little
commotion in the immediate vicinity of
the speaker, the rest of the audience continued
to listen intently. “What,” proceeded
the preacher, pointing to the corse,
“what hath laid thee there, servant of
God?”&mdash;“Pride, ignorance, and fear,” answered
the same voice, in accents still more
thrilling. The disturbance now became
universal. The preacher paused, and a
circle opening, disclosed the figure of a
monk belonging to the convent, who stood
among them. * * *
* * * *</p>

<p>After all the usual modes of admonition,
exhortation, and discipline had been
employed, and the bishop of the diocese,
who, under the report of these extraordinary
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" title="85"> </a>
circumstances, had visited the convent
in person to obtain some explanation
from the contumacious monk in vain, it
was agreed, in a chapter extraordinary,
to surrender him to the power of the
Inquisition. He testified great horror
when this determination was made known
to him,&mdash;and offered to tell over and
over again all that he <em>could</em> relate of the
cause of Father Olavida’s death. His humiliation,
and repeated offers of confession,
came too late. He was conveyed to
the Inquisition. The proceedings of that
tribunal are rarely disclosed, but there is a
secret report (I cannot answer for its truth)
of what he said and suffered there. On
his first examination, he said he would relate
all he <em>could</em>. He was told that was
not enough, he must relate all he knew. *
* * * * * * * *
“Why did you testify such horror at the
funeral of Father Olavida?”&mdash;“Every one
testified horror and grief at the death of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_86" title="86"> </a>
that venerable ecclesiastic, who died in the
odour of sanctity. Had I done otherwise,
it might have been reckoned a proof of
my guilt.” “Why did you interrupt the
preacher with such extraordinary exclamations?”&mdash;To
this no answer. “Why do
you refuse to explain the meaning of
those exclamations?”&mdash;No answer. “Why
do you persist in this obstinate and
dangerous silence? Look, I beseech you,
brother, at the cross that is suspended against
this wall,” and the Inquisitor pointed
to the large black crucifix at the back
of the chair where he sat; “one drop of
the blood shed there can purify you from
all the sin you have ever committed; but
all that blood, combined with the intercession
of the Queen of Heaven, and the
merits of all its martyrs, nay, even the
absolution of the Pope, cannot deliver
you from the curse of dying in unrepented
sin.”&mdash;“What sin, then, have I committed?”
“The greatest of all possible
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" title="87"> </a>
sins; you refuse answering the questions
put to you at the tribunal of the most
holy and merciful Inquisition;&mdash;you will
not tell us what you know concerning the
death of Father Olavida.”&mdash;“I have told
you that I believe he perished in consequence
of his ignorance and presumption.”
“What proof can you produce of that?”&mdash;“He
sought the knowledge of a secret
withheld from man.” “What was that?”&mdash;“The
secret of discovering the presence
or agency of the evil power.” “Do you
possess that secret?”&mdash;After much agitation
on the part of the prisoner, he said distinctly,
but very faintly, “My master forbids me
to disclose it.” “If your master were Jesus
Christ, he would not forbid you to
obey the commands, or answer the questions
of the Inquisition.”&mdash;“I am not
sure of that.” There was a general outcry
of horror at these words. The examination
then went on. “If you believed
Olavida to be guilty of any pursuits or
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" title="88"> </a>
studies condemned by our mother the
church, why did you not denounce him
to the Inquisition?”&mdash;“Because I believed
him not likely to be injured by such pursuits;
his mind was too weak,&mdash;he died in
the struggle,” said the prisoner with great
emphasis. “You believe, then, it requires
strength of mind to keep those abominable
secrets, when examined as to their nature
and tendency?”&mdash;“No, I rather imagine
strength of body.” “We shall try that
presently,” said an Inquisitor, giving a
signal for the torture. * * *
* * * * * * * *
The prisoner underwent the first and second
applications with unshrinking courage,
but on the infliction of the water-torture,
which is indeed insupportable to
humanity, either to suffer or relate, he exclaimed
in the gasping interval, he would
disclose every thing. He was released,
refreshed, restored, and the following day
uttered the following remarkable confession
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" title="89"> </a>
* * * * *
* * * * * *</p>

<p>The old Spanish woman further confessed
to Stanton, that * * *
* * * * * * and that
the Englishman certainly had been seen
in the neighbourhood since;&mdash;seen, as she
had heard, that very night. “Great
G&mdash;d!” exclaimed Stanton, as he recollected
the stranger whose demoniac laugh
had so appalled him, while gazing on the
lifeless bodies of the lovers, whom the
lightning had struck and blasted.</p>

<hr class="thought-break"/>

<p>As the manuscript, after a few blotted
and illegible pages, became more distinct,
Melmoth read on, perplexed and unsatisfied,
not knowing what connexion this
Spanish story could have with his ancestor,
whom, however, he recognised under
the title of <em>the Englishman</em>; and wondering
how Stanton could have thought it
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_90" title="90"> </a>
worth his while to follow him to Ireland,
write a long manuscript about an event
that occurred in Spain, and leave it in the
hands of his family, to “verify untrue
things,” in the language of Dogberry,&mdash;his
wonder was diminished, though his
curiosity was still more inflamed, by the
perusal of the next lines, which he made
out with some difficulty. It seems Stanton
was now in England. * * *
* * * * * * * *</p>

<p>About the year 1677, Stanton was in
London, his mind still full of his mysterious
countryman. This constant subject
of his contemplations had produced a visible
change in his exterior,&mdash;his walk was
what Sallust tells us of Catiline’s,&mdash;his
were, too, the “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fœdi oculi</i>.” He said to
himself every moment, “If I could but
trace that being, I will not call him man,”&mdash;and
the next moment he said, “and
what if I could?” In this state of mind,
it is singular enough that he mixed constantly
in public amusements, but it is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_91" title="91"> </a>
true. When one fierce passion is devouring
the soul, we feel more than ever the
necessity of external excitement; and our
dependence on the world for temporary
relief increases in direct proportion to our
contempt of the world and all its works.
He went frequently to the theatres, <em>then</em>
fashionable, when</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“The fair sat panting at a courtier’s play,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">And not a mask went unimproved away.”<br/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The London theatres then presented
a spectacle which ought for ever to put
to silence the foolish outcry against progressive
deterioration of morals,&mdash;foolish
even from the pen of Juvenal, and still
more so from the lips of a modern Puritan.
Vice is always nearly on an average:
The only difference in life worth
tracing, is that of manners, and there we
have manifestly the advantage of our ancestors.
Hypocrisy is said to be the homage
that vice pays to virtue,&mdash;decorum is
the outward expression of that homage;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_92" title="92"> </a>
and if this be so, we must acknowledge
that vice has latterly grown very humble
indeed. There was, however, something
splendid, ostentatious, and obtrusive, in
the vices of Charles the Second’s reign.&mdash;A
view of the theatres alone proved it,
when Stanton was in the habit of visiting
them. At the doors stood on one side the
footmen of a fashionable nobleman, (with
arms concealed under their liveries), surrounding
the sedan of a popular actress<a name="FootnoteMarker_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="footnote-marker">(1)</a>,
whom they were to carry off <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vi et armis</i>,
as she entered it at the end of the play.
At the other side waited the <em>glass coach</em>
of a woman of fashion, who waited to
take Kynaston (the Adonis of the day), in
his female dress, to the park after the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_93" title="93"> </a>
play was over, and exhibit him in all the
luxurious splendour of effeminate beauty,
(heightened by theatrical dress), for which
he was so distinguished.</p>

<p>Plays being then performed at four
o’clock, allowed ample time for the evening
drive, and the midnight assignation,
when the parties met by torch-light, masked,
in St James’s park, and verified the title
of Wycherly’s play, “Love in a Wood.”
The boxes, as Stanton looked round him,
were filled with females, whose naked
shoulders and bosoms, well testified in the
paintings of Lely, and the pages of Grammont,
might save modern puritanism many
a vituperative groan and affected reminiscence.
They had all taken the precaution
to send some male relative, on the first
night of a new play, to report whether it was
fit for persons of “honour and reputation”
to appear at; but in spite of this precaution,
at certain passages (which occurred about
every second sentence) they were compelled
to spread out their fans, or play with the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" title="94"> </a>
still cherished love-lock, which Prynne himself
had not been able to write down.</p>

<p>The men in the boxes were composed of
two distinct classes, the “men of wit and
pleasure about town,” distinguished by
their Flanders lace cravats, soiled with
snuff, their diamond rings, the pretended
gift of a royal mistress, (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">n’importe</i> whether
the Duchess of Portsmouth or Nell
Gwynne); their uncombed wigs, whose
curls descended to their waists, and the
loud and careless tone in which they abused
Dryden, Lee, and Otway, and quoted
Sedley and Rochester;&mdash;the other class
were the lovers, the gentle “squires of
dames,” equally conspicuous for their white
fringed gloves, their obsequious bows, and
their commencing every sentence addressed
to a lady, with the profane exclamation
of <a name="FootnoteMarker_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="footnote-marker">(2)</a>“Oh Jesu!” or the softer, but equally
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_95" title="95"> </a>
unmeaning one of “I beseech you, Madam,”
or, “Madam, I burn<a name="FootnoteMarker_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="footnote-marker">(3)</a>.” One circumstance
sufficiently extraordinary marked
the manners of the day; females had not
then found their proper level in life; they
were alternately adored as goddesses, and
assailed as prostitutes; and the man who,
this moment, addressed his mistress in language
borrowed from Orondates worshipping
Cassandra, in the next accosted her
with ribaldry that might put to the blush
the piazzas of Covent Garden<a name="FootnoteMarker_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="footnote-marker">(4)</a>.</p>

<p>The pit presented a more various spectacle.
There were the critics armed cap-a-pee from
Aristotle and Bossu; these men dined at
twelve, dictated at a coffee-house till four,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_96" title="96"> </a>
then called to the boy to brush their shoes,
and strode to the theatre, where, till the
curtain rose, they sat hushed in grim repose,
and expecting their evening prey.
There were the templars, spruce, pert, and
loquacious; and here and there a sober
citizen, doffing his steeple-crowned hat,
and hiding his little band under the folds
of his huge puritanic cloke, while his eyes,
declined with an expression half leering,
half ejaculatory, towards a masked female,
muffled in a hood and scarf, testified what
had seduced him into these “tents of Kedar.”
There were females, too, but all in
vizard masks, which, though worn as well
as aunt Dinah’s in Tristram Shandy, served
to conceal them from the “young bubbles”
they were in quest of, and from all but
the orange-women, who hailed them loudly
as they passed the doors<a name="FootnoteMarker_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="footnote-marker">(5)</a>. In the galleries
were the happy souls who waited for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_97" title="97"> </a>
the fulfilment of Dryden’s promise in one
of his prologues<a name="FootnoteMarker_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="footnote-marker">(6)</a>; no matter to them whether
it were the ghost of Almanzor’s mother
in her dripping shroud, or that of
Laius, who, according to the stage directions,
rises in his chariot, armed with the
ghosts of his three murdered attendants
behind him;&mdash;a joke that did not escape
l’Abbe le Blanc<a name="FootnoteMarker_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="footnote-marker">(7)</a>, in his recipe for writing
an English tragedy. Some, indeed, from
time to time called out for the “burning
of the Pope;” but though</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Space was obedient to the boundless piece,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">Which oped in Mexico and closed in Greece,”<br/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">it was not always possible to indulge them
in this laudable amusement, as the scene
of the popular plays was generally laid in
Africa or Spain; Sir Robert Howard, Elkanah
Settle, and John Dryden, all agreeing
in their choice of Spanish and Moorish
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_98" title="98"> </a>
subjects for their principal plays. Among
this joyous groupe were seated several
women of fashion masked, enjoying in
secrecy the licentiousness which they dared
not openly patronise, and verifying
Gay’s characteristic description, though
it was written many years later,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Mobbed in the gallery Laura sits secure,<br/></div>
<div class="line indent1">And laughs at jests that turn the box demure.”<br/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Stanton gazed on all this with the look of
one who “could not be moved to smile at
any thing.” He turned to the stage, the
play was Alexander, then acted as written
by Lee, and the principal character was
performed by Hart, whose god-like ardour
in making love, is said almost to have
compelled the audience to believe that they
beheld the “son of Ammon.”</p>

<p>There were absurdities enough to offend
a classical, or even a rational spectator.
There were Grecian heroes with roses in
their shoes, feathers in their hats, and wigs
down to their waists; and Persian princesses
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_99" title="99"> </a>
in stiff stays and powdered hair.
But the illusion of the scene was well
sustained, for the heroines were rivals in
real as well as theatrical life. It was that
memorable night, when, according to the
history of the veteran Betterton<a name="FootnoteMarker_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="footnote-marker">(8)</a>, Mrs
Barry, who personated Roxana, had a
green-room squabble with Mrs Bowtell,
the representative of Statira, about a veil,
which the partiality of the property-man
adjudged to the latter. Roxana suppressed
her rage till the fifth act, when, stabbing
Statira, she aimed the blow with such
force as to pierce through her stays, and
inflict a severe though not dangerous
wound. Mrs Bowtell fainted, the performance
was suspended, and, in the commotion
which this incident caused in the
house, many of the audience rose, and
Stanton among them. It was at this moment
that, in a seat opposite to him, he
discovered the object of his search for four
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_100" title="100"> </a>
years,&mdash;the Englishman whom he had met
in the plains of Valentia, and whom he believed
the same with the subject of the extraordinary
narrative he had heard there.</p>

<p>He was standing up. There was nothing
particular or remarkable in his appearance,
but the expression of his eyes
could never be mistaken or forgotten.
The heart of Stanton palpitated with violence,&mdash;a
mist overspread his eyes,&mdash;a
nameless and deadly sickness, accompanied
with a creeping sensation in every
pore, from which cold drops were gushing,
announced the * * *
* * * * * * *
Before he had well recovered, a strain of
music, soft, solemn, and delicious, breathed
round him, audibly ascending from the
ground, and increasing in sweetness and
power till it seemed to fill the whole building.
Under the sudden impulse of amazement
and pleasure, he inquired of some
around him from whence those exquisite
sounds arose. But, by the manner in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_101" title="101"> </a>
which he was answered, it was plain that
those he addressed considered him insane;
and, indeed, the remarkable change in his
expression might well justify the suspicion.
He then remembered that night in
Spain, when the same sweet and mysterious
sounds were heard only by the young
bridegroom and bride, of whom the latter
perished on that very night. “And am I
then to be the next victim?” thought
Stanton; “and are those celestial sounds,
that seem to prepare us for heaven, only
intended to announce the presence of an
incarnate fiend, who mocks the devoted
with ‘airs from heaven,’ while he prepares
to surround them with ‘blasts from hell’?”
It is very singular that at this moment,
when his imagination had reached its
highest pitch of elevation,&mdash;when the object
he had pursued so long and fruitlessly,
had in one moment become as it were
tangible to the grasp both of mind and
body,&mdash;when this spirit, with whom he had
wrestled in darkness, was at last about to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_102" title="102"> </a>
declare its name, that Stanton began to
feel a kind of disappointment at the futility
of his pursuits, like Bruce at discovering
the source of the Nile, or Gibbon
on concluding his History. The feeling
which he had dwelt on so long, that he
had actually converted it into a duty, was
after all mere curiosity; but what passion
is more insatiable, or more capable
of giving a kind of romantic grandeur to
all its wanderings and eccentricities? Curiosity
is in one respect like love, it always
compromises between the object and
the feeling; and provided the latter possesses
sufficient energy, no matter how
contemptible the former may be. A child
might have smiled at the agitation of
Stanton, caused as it was by the accidental
appearance of a stranger; but no man,
in the full energy of his passions, was
there, but must have trembled at the horrible
agony of emotion with which he felt
approaching, with sudden and irresistible
velocity, the crisis of his destiny.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" title="103"> </a>When the play was over, he stood
for some moments in the deserted streets.
It was a beautiful moonlight night, and he
saw near him a figure, whose shadow, projected
half across the street, (there were
no flagged ways then, chains and posts
were the only defence of the foot-passenger),
appeared to him of gigantic magnitude.
He had been so long accustomed
to contend with these phantoms of the
imagination, that he took a kind of stubborn
delight in subduing them. He walked
up to the object, and observing the
shadow only was magnified, and the figure
was the ordinary height of man, he approached
it, and discovered the very object
of his search,&mdash;the man whom he had
seen for a moment in Valentia, and, after
a search of four years, recognised at the
theatre. * * * * *
* * * * * *</p>

<p>“You were in quest of me?”&mdash;“I
was.” “Have you any thing to inquire
of me?”&mdash;“Much.” “Speak, then.”&mdash;“This
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_104" title="104"> </a>
is no place.” “No place! poor
wretch, I am independent of time and
place. Speak, if you have any thing to
ask or to learn?”&mdash;“I have many things
to ask, but nothing to learn, I hope, from
you.” “You deceive yourself, but you
will be undeceived when next we meet.”&mdash;“And
when shall that be?” said Stanton,
grasping his arm; “name your hour
and your place.” “The hour shall be
mid-day,” answered the stranger, with a
horrid and unintelligible smile; “and the
place shall be the bare walls of a mad-house,
where you shall rise rattling in
your chains, and rustling from your straw,
to greet me,&mdash;yet still you shall have <em>the
curse of sanity</em>, and of memory. My
voice shall ring in your ears till then, and
the glance of these eyes shall be reflected
from every object, animate or inanimate,
till you behold them again.”&mdash;“Is it under
circumstances so horrible we are to meet
again?” said Stanton, shrinking under the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" title="105"> </a>
full-lighted blaze of those demon eyes.
“I never,” said the stranger, in an emphatic
tone,&mdash;“I <em>never desert my friends
in misfortune</em>. When they are plunged
in the lowest abyss of human calamity,
<em>they are sure to be visited by me</em>.” *
* * * *</p>

<p>The narrative, when Melmoth was again
able to trace its continuation, described
Stanton, some years after, plunged in a
state the most deplorable.</p>

<p>He had been always reckoned of a singular
turn of mind, and the belief of this,
aggravated by his constant talk of Melmoth,
his wild pursuit of him, his strange
behaviour at the theatre, and his dwelling
on the various particulars of their extraordinary
meetings, with all the intensity
of the deepest conviction, (while he never
could impress them on any one’s conviction
but his own), suggested to some prudent
people the idea that he was deranged.
Their malignity probably took part with
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_106" title="106"> </a>
their prudence. The selfish Frenchman<a name="FootnoteMarker_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="footnote-marker">(9)</a>
says, we feel a pleasure even in the misfortunes
of our friends,&mdash;<em>a plus forte</em> in
those of our enemies; and as every one is
an enemy to a man of genius of course,
the report of Stanton’s malady was propagated
with infernal and successful industry.
Stanton’s next relative, a needy unprincipled
man, watched the report in its
circulation, and saw the snares closing
round his victim. He waited on him one
morning, accompanied by a person of a
grave, though somewhat repulsive appearance.
Stanton was as usual abstracted
and restless, and, after a few moments
conversation, he proposed a drive a few
miles out of London, which he said would
revive and refresh him. Stanton objected,
on account of the difficulty of getting a
hackney coach, (for it is singular that at
this period the number of private equipages,
though infinitely fewer than they
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_107" title="107"> </a>
are now, exceeded the number of hired
ones), and proposed going by water. This,
however, did not suit the kinsman’s views;
and, after pretending to send for a carriage,
(which was in waiting at the end of
the street), Stanton and his companions
entered it, and drove about two miles out
of London.</p>

<p>The carriage then stopped. “Come,
Cousin,” said the younger Stanton,&mdash;“come
and view a purchase I have made.”
Stanton absently alighted, and followed
him across a small paved court; the other
person followed. “In troth, Cousin,” said
Stanton, “your choice appears not to have
been discreetly made; your house has
something of a gloomy aspect.”&mdash;“Hold
you content, Cousin,” replied the other;
“I shall take order that you like it better,
when you have been some time a dweller
therein.” Some attendants of a mean appearance,
and with most suspicious visages,
awaited them on their entrance, and they
ascended a narrow staircase, which led to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" title="108"> </a>
a room meanly furnished. “Wait here,”
said the kinsman, to the man who accompanied
them, “till I go for company to
divertise my cousin in his loneliness.” They
were left alone. Stanton took no notice
of his companion, but as usual seized the
first book near him, and began to read. It
was a volume in manuscript,&mdash;they were
then much more common than now.</p>

<p>The first lines struck him as indicating
insanity in the writer. It was a wild proposal
(written apparently after the great
fire of London) to rebuild it with stone,
and attempting to prove, on a calculation
wild, false, and yet sometimes plausible,
that this could be done out of the colossal
fragments of Stonehenge, which the writer
proposed to remove for that purpose.
Subjoined were several grotesque drawings
of engines designed to remove those massive
blocks, and in a corner of the page
was a note,&mdash;“I would have drawn these
more accurately, but was not allowed <em>a
knife</em> to mend my pen.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" title="109"> </a>The next was entitled, “A modest proposal
for the spreading of Christianity in
foreign parts, whereby it is hoped its entertainment
will become general all over
the world.”&mdash;This modest proposal was, to
convert the Turkish ambassadors, (who
had been in London a few years before),
by offering them their choice of being
strangled on the spot, or becoming Christians.
Of course the writer reckoned on
their embracing the easier alternative, but
even this was to be clogged with a heavy
condition,&mdash;namely, that they must be
bound before a magistrate to convert
twenty mussulmans a day, on their return
to Turkey. The rest of the pamphlet
was reasoned very much in the conclusive
style of Captain Bobadil,&mdash;these twenty
will convert twenty more a piece, and
these two hundred converts, converting
their due number in the same time, all
Turkey would be converted before the
Grand Signior knew where he was. Then
comes the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup d’eclat</i>,&mdash;one fine morning,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_110" title="110"> </a>
every minaret in Constantinople was
to ring out with bells, instead of the cry
of the Muezzins; and the Imaum, coming
out to see what was the matter, was to be
encountered by the Archbishop of Canterbury,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in pontificalibus</i>, performing Cathedral
service in the church of St Sophia,
which was to finish the business. Here
an objection appeared to arise, which the
ingenuity of the writer had anticipated.&mdash;“It
may be redargued,” saith he, “by
those who have more spleen than brain,
that forasmuch as the Archbishop preacheth
in English, he will not thereby much
edify the Turkish folk, who do altogether
hold in a vain gabble of their own.” But
this (to use his own language) he “evites,”
by judiciously observing, that where service
was performed in an unknown
tongue, the devotion of the people was
always observed to be much increased
thereby; as, for instance, in the church
of Rome,&mdash;that St Augustine, with his
monks, advanced to meet King Ethelbert
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_111" title="111"> </a>
singing litanies, (in a language his majesty
could not <ins title="posssibly">possibly</ins> have understood),
and converted him and his whole court on
the spot;&mdash;that the sybilline books *
* * * * * * *
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cum multis aliis.</i></p>

<p>Between the pages were cut most exquisitely
in paper the <ins title="liknesses">likenesses</ins> of some of
these Turkish ambassadors; the hair of
the beards, in particular, was feathered
with a delicacy of touch that seemed the
work of fairy fingers,&mdash;but the pages
ended with a complaint of the operator,
that his <em>scissars had been taken from him</em>.
However, he consoled himself and the
reader with the assurance, that he would
that night catch a moon-beam as it entered
through the grating, and, when he had
whetted it on the iron knobs of his door,
would do wonders with it. In the next
page was found a melancholy proof of
powerful but prostrated intellect. It contained
some insane lines, ascribed to Lee
the dramatic poet, commencing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_112" title="112"> </a><div class="line">“O that my lungs could bleat like buttered pease,” &amp;c.<br/></div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is no proof whatever that these
miserable lines were really written by Lee,
except that the measure is the fashionable
quatrain of the period. It is singular that
Stanton read on without suspicion of his
own danger, quite absorbed in <em>the album
of a mad-house</em>, without ever reflecting on
the place where he was, and which such
compositions too manifestly designated.</p>

<p>It was after a long interval that he looked
round, and perceived that his companion
was gone. Bells were unusual then.
He proceeded to the door,&mdash;it was fastened.
He called aloud,&mdash;his voice was echoed
in a moment by many others, but in
tones so wild and discordant, that he desisted
in involuntary terror. As the day
advanced, and no one approached, he tried
the window, and then perceived for the
first time it was grated. It looked out on
the narrow flagged yard, in which no human
being was; and if there had, from
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" title="113"> </a>
such a being no human feeling could have
been extracted.</p>

<p>Sickening with unspeakable horror, he
sunk rather than sat down beside the miserable
window, and “wished for day.”</p>

<p class="center">* &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; *</p>

<p>At midnight he started from a doze, half
a swoon, half a sleep, which probably the
hardness of his seat, and of the deal table
on which he leaned, had not contributed
to prolong.</p>

<p>He was in complete darkness; the horror
of his situation struck him at once,
and for a moment he was indeed almost
qualified for an inmate of that dreadful
mansion. He felt his way to the door,
shook it with desperate strength, and uttered
the most frightful cries, mixed with
expostulations and commands. His cries
were in a moment echoed by a hundred
voices. In maniacs there is a peculiar
malignity, accompanied by an extraordinary
acuteness of some of the senses, particularly
in distinguishing the voice of a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" title="114"> </a>
stranger. The cries that he heard on every
side seemed like a wild and infernal yell of
joy, that their mansion of misery had obtained
another tenant.</p>

<p>He paused, exhausted,&mdash;a quick and
thundering step was heard in the passage.
The door was opened, and a man of savage
appearance stood at the entrance,&mdash;two
more were seen indistinctly in the passage.&mdash;“Release
me, villain!” “Stop, my fine
fellow, what’s all this noise for?” “Where
am I?” “Where you ought to be.”
“Will you dare to detain me?” “Yes,
and a little more than that,” answered the
ruffian, applying a loaded horse-whip to
his back and shoulders, till the patient
soon fell to the ground convulsed with
rage and pain. “Now you see you are
where you ought to be,” repeated the ruffian,
brandishing the horse-whip over him,
“and now take the advice of a friend,
and make no more noise. The lads are
ready for you with the darbies, and they’ll
clink them on in the crack of this whip,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" title="115"> </a>
unless you prefer another touch of it first.”
They then were advancing into the room
as he spoke, with fetters in their hands,
(strait waistcoats being then little known
or used), and shewed, by their frightful
countenances and gestures, no unwillingness
to apply them. Their harsh rattle on
the stone pavement made Stanton’s blood
run cold; the effect, however, was useful.
He had the presence of mind to
acknowledge his (supposed) miserable condition,
to supplicate the forbearance of the
ruthless keeper, and promise complete submission
to his orders. This pacified the
ruffian, and he retired.</p>

<p>Stanton collected all his resolution to
encounter the horrible night; he saw all
that was before him, and summoned himself
to meet it. After much agitated deliberation,
he conceived it best to continue
the same appearance of submission and
tranquillity, hoping that thus he might in
time either propitiate the wretches in
whose hands he was, or, by his apparent
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_116" title="116"> </a>
inoffensiveness, procure such opportunities
of indulgence, as might perhaps ultimately
facilitate his escape. He therefore
determined to conduct himself with the
utmost tranquillity, and never to let his
voice be heard in the house; and he laid
down several other resolutions with a degree
of prudence which he already shuddered
to think might be the cunning of
incipient madness, or the beginning result
of the horrid habits of the place.</p>

<p>These resolutions were put to desperate
trial that very night. Just next to Stanton’s
apartment were lodged two most uncongenial
neighbours. One of them was
a puritanical weaver, who had been driven
mad by a single sermon from the celebrated
Hugh Peters, and was sent to the
mad-house as full of election and reprobation
as he could hold,&mdash;and fuller. He
regularly repeated over the <em>five points</em>
while day-light lasted, and imagined himself
preaching in a conventicle with distinguished
success; towards twilight his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" title="117"> </a>
visions were more gloomy, and at midnight
his blasphemies became horrible. In
the opposite cell was lodged a loyalist
tailor, who had been ruined by giving
credit to the cavaliers and their ladies,&mdash;(for
at this time, and much later, down to
the reign of Anne, tailors were employed
by females even <em>to make</em> and <em>fit on their
stays</em>),&mdash;who had run mad with drink and
loyalty on the burning of the Rump, and
ever since had made the cells of the mad-house
echo with fragments of the ill-fated
Colonel Lovelace’s songs, scraps from
Cowley’s “Cutter of Coleman street,” and
some curious specimens from Mrs Aphra
<ins title="Beha’s">Behn’s</ins> plays, where the cavaliers are denominated
the <em>heroicks</em>, and Lady Lambert
and Lady Desborough represented as going
to meeting, their large Bibles carried
before them by their pages, and falling in
love with two banished cavaliers by the
way.&mdash;“Tabitha, Tabitha,” cried a voice
half in exultation and half in derision;
“thou shalt go with thy hair curled, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_118" title="118"> </a>
thy breasts naked;”&mdash;and then added in
an affected voice,&mdash;“I could dance the
Canaries once, spouse.” This never failed
to rouse the feelings, or rather operate on
the instincts of the puritanic weaver, who
immediately answered, “Colonel Harrison
shall come out of the west, riding on a
sky-coloured mule, which signifies instruction<a name="FootnoteMarker_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="footnote-marker">(10)</a>.”
“Ye lie, ye round-head son of a
b<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>h,” roared the cavalier tailor, “Colonel
Harrison will be damned before he
ever mounts a sky-coloured mule;” and
he concluded this pithy sentence with
fragments of anti-Oliverian songs.</p>

<p>“Ye are honest gentlemen, I can play
many tunes,” squeaked a poor mad loyalist
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" title="119"> </a>
fiddler, who had been accustomed to play
in the taverns to the cavalier party, and
just remembered the words of a similar
minstrel playing for Colonel Blunt in the
committee. “Then play me the air to
“Rebellion is breaking up house,” exclaimed
the tailor, dancing wildly about
his cell (as far as his chains allowed him)
to an imaginary measure. The weaver
could contain no longer. “How long,
Lord, how long,” he exclaimed, “shall
thine enemies insult thy sanctuary, in
which I have been placed an anointed
teacher? even here, where I am placed to
preach to the souls in prison?&mdash;Open the
flood-gates of thy power, and though thy
waves and storms go over me, let me testify
in the midst of them, even as he who
spreadeth forth his hands to swim may
raise one of them to warn his companion
that he is about to sink.&mdash;Sister Ruth,
why dost thou uncover thy bosom to discover
my frailty?&mdash;Lord, let thine arm of
power be with us as it was when thou
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_120" title="120"> </a>
brakest the shield, the sword, and the
battle,&mdash;when thy foot was dipped in the
blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of
thy dogs was red through the same.&mdash;Dip
all thy garments in blood, and let me
weave thee fresh when thou art stained.&mdash;When
shall thy saints tread the wine-press
of thy wrath? Blood! blood! the
saints call for it, earth gapes to swallow it,
hell thirsts for it!&mdash;Sister Ruth, I pray
thee, conceal thy bosom, and be not as
the vain women of this generation.&mdash;Oh
for a day like that, a day of the Lord of
hosts, when the towers fell!&mdash;Spare me in
the battle, for I am not a mighty man of
war; leave me in the rear of the host, to
curse, with the curse of Meroz, those who
come not to the help of the Lord against
the mighty,&mdash;even to curse this malignant
tailor,&mdash;yea, curse him bitterly.&mdash;Lord, I
am in the tents of Kedar, my feet stumble
on the dark mountains,&mdash;I fall,&mdash;I fall!”&mdash;And
the poor wretch, exhausted by his
delirious agonies, fell, and grovelled for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_121" title="121"> </a>
some time in his straw. “Oh! I have had
a grievous fall,&mdash;Sister Ruth,&mdash;Oh Sister
Ruth!&mdash;Rejoice not against me, Oh mine
enemy! though I fall, I shall rise again.”
Whatever satisfaction Sister Ruth might
have derived from this assurance, if she
could have heard it, was enjoyed tenfold
by the weaver, whose amorous reminiscences
were in a moment exchanged for war-like
ones, borrowed from a wretched and
disarranged mass of intellectual rubbish.
“The Lord is a man of war,” he shouted.&mdash;“Look
to Marston Moor!&mdash;Look to the
city, the proud city, full of pride and sin!&mdash;Look
to the waves of the Severn, as
red with blood as the waves of the Red
Sea!&mdash;There were the hoofs broken by
means of the prancings, the prancings of
the mighty ones.&mdash;Then, Lord, was thy
triumph, and the triumph of thy saints,
to bind their kings in chains, and their
nobles in links of iron.” The malignant
tailor burst out in his turn: “Thank the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_122" title="122"> </a>
false Scots, and their solemn league and
covenant, and Carisbrook Castle, for that,
ye crop-eared Puritan,” he yelled. “If it
had not been for them, I would have
taken measure of the king for a velvet
cloak as high as the Tower of London,
and one flirt of its folds would have knocked
the “copper nose” into the Thames,
and sent it a-drift to Hell.” “Ye lie, in
your teeth,” echoed the weaver; “and I will
prove it unarmed, with my shuttle against
your needle, and smite you to the earth
thereafter, as David smote <ins title="Goliah">Goliath</ins>. It was
<em>the man’s</em> (such was the indecent language
in which Charles the First was spoken of
by the Puritans)&mdash;it was the man’s carnal,
self-seeking, world-loving, prelatical hierarchy,
that drove the godly to seek the
sweet word in season from their own
pastors, who righteously abominated the
Popish garniture of lawn-sleeves, lewd
organs, and steeple houses. Sister Ruth,
tempt me not with that calf’s head, it is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_123" title="123"> </a>
all streaming with blood;&mdash;drop it, I beseech
thee, sister, it is unmeet in a woman’s
hand, though the brethren drink of
it.&mdash;Woe be unto thee, gainsayer, dost
thou not see how flames envelope the accursed
city under his Arminian and Popish
son?&mdash;London is on fire!&mdash;on fire!”
he yelled; “and the brands are lit by
the half-papist, whole-arminian, all-damned
people thereof.&mdash;Fire!&mdash;fire!” The voice
in which he shrieked out the last words
was powerfully horrible, but it was like
the moan of an infant, compared to the
voice which took up and re-echoed the
cry, in a tone that made the building
shake. It was the voice of a maniac, who
had lost her husband, children, subsistence,
and finally her reason, in the dreadful fire
of London. The cry of fire never failed
to operate with terrible punctuality on her
associations. She had been in a disturbed
sleep, and now started from it as suddenly
as on that dreadful night. It was Saturday
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_124" title="124"> </a>
night, too, and she was always observed
to be particularly violent on that
night,&mdash;it was the terrible weekly festival
of insanity with her. She was awake, and
busy in a moment escaping from the
flames; and she dramatized the whole
scene with such hideous fidelity, that
Stanton’s resolution was far more in danger
from her than from the battle between
his neighbours <em>Testimony</em> and <em>Hothead</em>.
She began exclaiming she was suffocated
by the smoke; then she sprung from her
bed, calling for a light, and appeared to
be struck by the sudden glare that burst
through her casement.&mdash;“The last day,” she
shrieked, “The last day! The very heavens
are on fire!”&mdash;“That will not come till
the Man of Sin be first destroyed,” cried
the weaver; “thou ravest of light and
fire, and yet thou art in utter darkness.&mdash;I
pity thee, poor mad soul, I pity thee!”
The maniac never heeded him; she appeared
to be scrambling up a stair-case to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_125" title="125"> </a>
her children’s room. She exclaimed she
was scorched, singed, suffocated; her courage
appeared to fail, and she retreated.
“But my children are there!” she cried
in a voice of unspeakable agony, as she
seemed to make another effort; “here I
am&mdash;here I am come to save you.&mdash;Oh
God! They are all blazing!&mdash;Take this
arm&mdash;no, not that, it is scorched and disabled&mdash;well,
any arm&mdash;take hold of my
clothes&mdash;no, they are blazing too!&mdash;Well,
take me all on fire as I am!&mdash;And their
hair, how it hisses!&mdash;Water, one drop of
water for my youngest&mdash;he is but an infant&mdash;for
my youngest, and let me burn!”
She paused in horrid silence, to watch the
fall of a blazing rafter that was about to
shatter the stair-case on which she stood.&mdash;“The
roof has fallen on my head!” she
exclaimed. “The earth is weak, and all
the inhabitants thereof,” chaunted the
weaver; “I bear up the pillars of it.”</p>

<p>The maniac marked the destruction of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_126" title="126"> </a>
the spot where she thought she stood by
one desperate bound, accompanied by a
wild shriek, and then calmly gazed on her
infants as they rolled over the scorching
fragments, and sunk into the abyss of fire
below. “There they go,&mdash;one&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;all!”
and her voice sunk into low
mutterings, and her convulsions into faint,
cold shudderings, like the sobbings of a
spent storm, as she imagined herself to
“stand in safety and despair,” amid the
thousand houseless wretches assembled in
the suburbs of London on the dreadful
nights after the fire, without food,
roof, or raiment, all gazing on the burning
ruins of their dwellings and their
property. She seemed to listen to their
complaints, and even repeated some of
them very affectingly, but invariably answered
them with the same words, “But
I have lost all my children&mdash;<em>all</em>!” It was
remarkable, that when this sufferer began
to rave, all the others became silent. The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_127" title="127"> </a>
cry of nature hushed every other cry,&mdash;she
was the only patient in the house who
was not mad from politics, religion, ebriety,
or some perverted passion; and terrifying
as the out-break of her frenzy always was,
Stanton used to await it as a kind of relief
from the dissonant, melancholy, and ludicrous
ravings of the others.</p>

<p>But the utmost efforts of his resolution
began to sink under the continued horrors
of the place. The impression on his senses
began to defy the power of reason to resist
them. He could not shut out these frightful
cries nightly repeated, nor the frightful
sound of the whip employed to still them.
Hope began to fail him, as he observed,
that the submissive tranquillity (which he
had imagined, by obtaining increased indulgence,
might contribute to his escape,
or perhaps convince the keeper of his
sanity) was interpreted by the callous ruffian,
who was acquainted only with the
varieties of <em>madness</em>, as a more refined
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_128" title="128"> </a>
species of that cunning which he was well
accustomed to watch and baffle.</p>

<p>On his first discovery of his situation,
he had determined to take the utmost care
of his health and intellect that the place
allowed, as the sole basis of his hope of
deliverance. But as that hope declined,
he neglected the means of realizing it.
He had at first risen early, walked incessantly
about his cell, and availed himself
of every opportunity of being in the open
air. He took the strictest care of his person
in point of cleanliness, and with or
without appetite, regularly forced down
his miserable meals; and all these efforts
were even pleasant, as long as hope
prompted them. But now he began to
relax them all. He passed half the day
in his wretched bed, in which he frequently
took his meals, declined shaving or
changing his linen, and, when the sun
shone into his cell, turned from it on his
straw with a sigh of heart-broken despondency.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_129" title="129"> </a>
Formerly, when the air breathed
through his grating, he used to say,
“Blessed air of heaven, I shall breathe
you once more in freedom!&mdash;Reserve all
your freshness for that delicious evening
when I shall inhale you, and be as free as
you myself.” Now when he felt it, he
sighed and said nothing. The twitter of
the sparrows, the pattering of rain, or the
moan of the wind, sounds that he used to
sit up in his bed to catch with delight, as
reminding him of nature, were now unheeded.</p>

<p>He began at times to listen with sullen
and horrible pleasure to the cries of his
miserable companions. He became squalid,
listless, torpid, and disgusting in his
appearance. * * *
* * * *</p>

<p>It was one of those dismal nights, that,
as he tossed on his loathsome bed,&mdash;more
loathsome from the impossibility to quit it
without feeling more “unrest,”&mdash;he perceived
the miserable light that burned in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_130" title="130"> </a>
the hearth was obscured by the intervention
of some dark object. He turned
feebly towards the light, without curiosity,
without excitement, but with a
wish to diversify the monotony of his misery,
by observing the slightest change
made even accidentally in the dusky atmosphere
of his cell. Between him and
the light stood the figure of Melmoth,
just as he had seen him from the first; the
figure was the same; the expression of the
face was the same,&mdash;cold, stony, and rigid;
the eyes, with their infernal and dazzling
lustre, were still the same.</p>

<p>Stanton’s ruling passion rushed on his
soul; he felt this apparition like a summons
to a high and fearful encounter. He
heard his heart beat audibly, and could
have exclaimed with Lee’s unfortunate heroine,&mdash;“It
pants as cowards do before
a battle; Oh the great march has sounded!”</p>

<p>Melmoth approached him with that
frightful calmness that mocks the terror
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_131" title="131"> </a>
it excites. “My prophecy has been fulfilled;&mdash;you
rise to meet me rattling from
your chains, and rustling from your straw&mdash;am
I not a true prophet?” Stanton
was silent. “Is not your situation very
miserable?”&mdash;Still Stanton was silent; for
he was beginning to believe this an illusion
of madness. He thought to himself,
“How could he have gained entrance
here?”&mdash;“Would you not wish
to be delivered from it?” Stanton tossed
on his straw, and its rustling seemed
to answer the question. “I have the
power to deliver you from it.” Melmoth
spoke very slowly and very softly, and the
melodious smoothness of his voice made a
frightful contrast to the stony rigour of his
features, and the fiend-like brilliancy of his
eyes. “Who are you, and whence come
you?” said Stanton, in a tone that was
meant to be interrogatory and imperative,
but which, from his habits of squalid debility,
was at once feeble and querulous.
His intellects had become affected by the
gloom of his miserable habitation, as the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_132" title="132"> </a>
wretched inmate of a similar mansion,
when produced before a medical examiner,
was reported to be a complete Albinos.&mdash;“His
skin was bleached, his eyes turned
white; he could not bear the light; and,
when exposed to it, he turned away with
a mixture of weakness and restlessness,
more like the writhings of a sick infant
than the struggles of a man.”</p>

<p>Such was Stanton’s situation; he was
enfeebled now, and the power of the enemy
seemed without a possibility of opposition
from either his intellectual or corporeal
powers. * * *
* * * * *</p>

<p>Of all their horrible dialogue, only these
words were legible in the manuscript,
“You know me now.”&mdash;“I always knew
you.”&mdash;“That is false; you imagined you
did, and that has been the cause of all the
wild * * * *
* * * * *
of the * * *
* * of your finally being lodged
in this mansion of misery, where only I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_133" title="133"> </a>
would seek, where only I can succour you.”
“You, demon!”&mdash;“Demon!&mdash;Harsh
words!&mdash;Was it a demon or a human
being placed you here?&mdash;Listen to me,
Stanton; nay, wrap not yourself in that
miserable blanket,&mdash;that cannot shut out
my words. Believe me, were you folded
in thunder-clouds, you must hear <em>me</em>!
Stanton, think of your misery. These
bare walls&mdash;what do they present to the
intellect or to the senses?&mdash;White-wash,
diversified with the scrawls of charcoal or
red chalk, that your happy predecessors
have left for you to trace over. You have
a taste for drawing,&mdash;I trust it will improve.
And here’s a grating, through
which the sun squints on you like a step-dame,
and the breeze blows, as if it meant
to tantalize <ins title="yon">you</ins> with a sigh from that
sweet mouth, whose kiss you must never
enjoy. And where’s your library,&mdash;intellectual
man,&mdash;travelled man?” he repeated
in a tone of bitter derision; “where be
your companions, your peaked men of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_134" title="134"> </a>
countries, as your favourite Shakespeare
has it? You must be content with the
spider and the rat, to crawl and scratch
round your flock-bed! I have known prisoners
in the Bastile to feed them for companions,&mdash;why
don’t you begin your task?
I have known a spider to descend at the
tap of a finger, and a rat to come forth
when the daily meal was brought, to share
it with his fellow-prisoner!&mdash;How delightful
to have vermin for your guests! Aye,
and when the feast fails them, they make
a meal of their entertainer!&mdash;You shudder&mdash;Are
you, then, the first prisoner who
has been devoured alive by the vermin
that infested his cell?&mdash;Delightful banquet,
not “where you eat, but where
you are eaten!” Your guests, however,
will give you one token of repentance
while they feed; there will be <em>gnashing
of teeth</em>, and you shall hear it, and
feel it too perchance!&mdash;And then for
meals&mdash;Oh you are daintily off!&mdash;The
soup that the cat has lapped; and (as her
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_135" title="135"> </a>
progeny has probably contributed to the
hell-broth) why not?<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span> Then your
hours of solitude, deliciously diversified
by the yell of famine, the howl of madness,
the crash of whips, and the broken-hearted
sob of those who, like you, are
supposed, or <em>driven</em> mad by the crimes of
others!&mdash;Stanton, do you imagine your
reason can possibly hold out amid such
scenes?&mdash;Supposing your reason was unimpaired,
your health not destroyed,&mdash;suppose
all this, which is, after all, more
than fair supposition can grant, guess the
effect of the continuance of these scenes
on your senses alone. A time will come,
and soon, when, from mere habit, you will
echo the scream of every delirious wretch
that harbours near you; then you will
pause, clasp your hands on your throbbing
head, and listen with horrible anxiety
whether the scream proceeded from <em>you</em> or
<em>them</em>. The time will come, when, from
the want of occupation, the listless and
horrible vacancy of your hours, you will
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_136" title="136"> </a>
feel as anxious to hear those shrieks, as
you were at first terrified to hear them,&mdash;when
you will watch for the ravings of your
next neighbour, as you would for a scene
on the stage. All humanity will be extinguished
in you. The ravings of these
wretches will become at once your sport
and your torture. You will watch for the
sounds, to mock them with the grimaces
and bellowings of a fiend. The mind has
a power of accommodating itself to its situation,
that you will experience in its
most frightful and deplorable efficacy.
Then comes the dreadful doubt of one’s
own sanity, the terrible announcer that
<em>that</em> doubt will soon become fear, and <em>that</em>
fear certainty. Perhaps (still more dreadful)
the <em>fear</em> will at last become a <em>hope</em>,&mdash;shut
out from society, watched by a brutal
keeper, writhing with all the impotent
agony of an incarcerated mind, without
communication and without sympathy, unable
to exchange ideas but with those
whose ideas are only the hideous spectres
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_137" title="137"> </a>
of departed intellect, or even to hear the
welcome sound of the human voice, except
to mistake it for the howl of a fiend, and
stop the ear desecrated by its intrusion,&mdash;then
at last your fear will become a more
fearful hope; you will wish to become one
of them, to escape the agony of consciousness.
As those who have long leaned over
a precipice, have at last felt a desire to
plunge below, to relieve the intolerable
temptation of their giddiness<a name="FootnoteMarker_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="footnote-marker">(11)</a>, you will
hear them laugh amid their wildest paroxysms;
you will say, ‘Doubtless those
wretches have some consolation, but I have
none; my sanity is my greatest curse in
this abode of horrors. They greedily devour
their miserable meals, while I loathe
mine. They sleep sometimes soundly,
while my sleep is&mdash;worse than their waking.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_138" title="138"> </a>
They are revived every morning by
some delicious illusion of cunning madness,
soothing them with the hope of escaping,
baffling or tormenting their keeper;
my sanity precludes all such hope. <em>I
know I never can escape</em>, and the preservation
of my faculties is only an aggravation
of my sufferings. I have all their
miseries,&mdash;I have none of their consolations.
They laugh,&mdash;I hear them; would
I could laugh like them.’ You will try,
and the very effort will be an invocation
to the demon of insanity to come and take
full possession of you from that moment
for ever.</p>

<p>(There were other details, both of the
menaces and temptations employed by
Melmoth, which are too horrible for insertion.
One of them may serve for an
instance).</p>

<p>“You think that the intellectual power
is something distinct from the vitality of
the soul, or, in other words, that if even
your reason should be destroyed, (which it
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_139" title="139"> </a>
nearly is), your soul might yet enjoy
beatitude in the full exercise of its enlarged
and exalted faculties, and all the clouds
which obscured them be dispelled by the
Sun of Righteousness, in whose beams
you hope to bask for ever and ever. Now,
without going into any metaphysical subtleties
about the distinction between mind
and soul, experience must teach you, that
there can be no crime into which madmen
would not, and do not precipitate themselves;
mischief is their occupation, malice
their habit, murder their sport, and
blasphemy their delight. Whether a soul
in this state can be in a hopeful one, it is
for you to judge; but it seems to me, that
with the loss of reason, (and reason cannot
long be retained in this place), you lose
also the hope of immortality.&mdash;Listen,”
said the tempter, pausing, “listen to the
wretch who is raving near you, and whose
blasphemies might make a demon start.&mdash;He
was once an eminent puritanical
preacher. Half the day he imagines himself
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_140" title="140"> </a>
in a pulpit, denouncing damnation
against Papists, Arminians, and even Sub-lapsarians,
(he being a Supra-lapsarian
himself). He foams, he writhes, he gnashes
his teeth; you would imagine him in
the hell he was painting, and that the fire
and brimstone he is so lavish of, were actually
exhaling from his jaws. At night
his <em>creed retaliates on him</em>; he believes
himself one of the reprobates he has been
all day denouncing, and curses God for
the very decree he has all day been glorifying
Him for.</p>

<p><ins title="He">“He</ins>, whom he has for twelve hours been
vociferating “is the loveliest among ten
thousand,” becomes the object of demoniac
hostility and execration. He grapples
with the iron posts of his bed, and says he
is rooting out the cross from the very
foundations of Calvary; and it is remarkable,
that in proportion as his morning
exercises are intense, vivid, and eloquent,
his nightly blasphemies are outrageous and
horrible.&mdash;Hark! Now he believes himself
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_141" title="141"> </a>
a demon; listen to his diabolical eloquence
of horror!”</p>

<p>Stanton listened, and shuddered *
* * * * *
“Escape&mdash;escape for your life,” cried the
tempter; “break forth into life, liberty,
and sanity. Your social happiness, your
intellectual powers, your immortal interests,
perhaps, depend on the choice of
this moment.&mdash;There is the door, and the
key is my hand. Choose&mdash;choose!”&mdash;“And
how comes the key in your hand? and
what is the condition of my liberation?”
said Stanton. * * *
* * * *</p>

<p>The explanation occupied several pages,
which, to the torture of young Melmoth,
were wholly illegible. It seemed, however,
to have been rejected by Stanton
with the utmost rage and horror, for Melmoth
at last made out,&mdash;“Begone, monster,
demon!&mdash;begone to your native
place. Even this mansion of horror
trembles to contain you; its walls sweat,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_142" title="142"> </a>
and its floors quiver, while you tread
them.” * * * *
* * * *</p>

<p>The conclusion of this extraordinary
manuscript was in such a state, that, in
fifteen mouldy and crumbling pages, Melmoth
could hardly make out that number
of lines. No antiquarian, unfolding with
trembling hand the calcined leaves of an
Herculaneum manuscript, and hoping to
discover some lost lines of the Æneis in
Virgil’s own autograph, or at least some
unutterable abomination of Petronius or
Martial, happily elucidatory of the mysteries
of the Spintriæ, or the orgies of the
Phallic worshippers, ever pored with more
luckless diligence, or shook a head of more
hopeless despondency over his task. He
could but just make out what tended rather
to excite than assuage that feverish
thirst of curiosity which was consuming
his inmost soul. The manuscript told no
more of Melmoth, but mentioned that
Stanton was finally liberated from his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_143" title="143"> </a>
confinement,&mdash;that his pursuit of Melmoth
was incessant and indefatigable,&mdash;that
he himself allowed it to be a species
of insanity,&mdash;that while he acknowledged
it to be the master-passion, he also felt it
the master-torment of his life. He again
visited the Continent, returned to England,&mdash;pursued,
inquired, traced, bribed,
but in vain. The being whom he had
met thrice, under circumstances so extraordinary,
he was fated never to encounter
again <em>in his life-time</em>. At length, discovering
that he had been born in Ireland,
he resolved to go there,&mdash;went, and found
his pursuit again fruitless, and his inquiries
unanswered. The family knew nothing
of him, or at least what they knew or imagined,
they prudently refused to disclose
to a stranger, and Stanton departed unsatisfied.
It is remarkable, that he too, as
appeared from many half-obliterated pages
of the manuscript, never disclosed to mortal
the particulars of their conversation in
the mad-house; and the slightest allusion
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_144" title="144"> </a>
to it threw him into fits of rage and gloom
equally singular and alarming. He left
the manuscript, however, in the hands of
the family, possibly deeming, from their
incuriosity, their apparent indifference to
their relative, or their obvious inacquaintance
with reading of any kind, manuscript
or books, his deposit would be safe. He
seems, in fact, to have acted like men,
who, in distress at sea, intrust their letters
and dispatches to a bottle sealed, and commit
it to the waves. The last lines of the
manuscript that were legible, were sufficiently
extraordinary. * *

<p>“I have sought him every where.&mdash;The
desire of meeting him once more, is become
as a burning fire within me,&mdash;it is
the necessary condition of my existence.
I have vainly sought him at last in Ireland,
of which I find he is a native.&mdash;Perhaps
our final meeting will be in * *
* * * *</p>

<p>Such was the conclusion of the manuscript
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_145" title="145"> </a>
which Melmoth found in his uncle’s
closet. When he had finished it, he sunk
down on the table near which he had been
reading it, his face hid in his folded arms,
his senses reeling, his mind in a mingled
state of stupor and excitement. After a
few moments, he raised himself with an
involuntary start, and saw the picture
gazing at him from its canvas. He was
within ten inches of it as he sat, and the
proximity appeared increased by the strong
light that was accidentally thrown on it,
and its being the only representation of a
human figure in the room. Melmoth felt
for a moment as if he were about to receive
an explanation from its lips.</p>

<p>He gazed on it in return,&mdash;all was
silent in the house,&mdash;they were alone together.
The illusion subsided at length;
and as the mind rapidly passes to opposite
extremes, he remembered the injunction
of his uncle to destroy the portrait. He
seized it;&mdash;his hand shook at first, but
the mouldering canvas appeared to assist
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_146" title="146"> </a>
him in the effort. He tore it from
the frame with a cry half terrific, half
triumphant;&mdash;it fell at his feet, and he
shuddered as it fell. He expected to hear
some fearful sounds, some unimaginable
breathings of prophetic horror, follow this
act of sacrilege, for such he felt it, to tear
the portrait of his ancestor from his native
walls. He paused and listened:&mdash;“There
was no voice, nor any that answered;”&mdash;but
as the wrinkled and torn canvas fell
to the floor, its undulations gave the portrait
the appearance of smiling. Melmoth
felt horror indescribable at this transient
and imaginary resuscitation of the figure.
He caught it up, rushed into the next room,
tore, cut, and hacked it in every direction,
and eagerly watched the fragments that
burned like tinder in the turf-fire which
had been lit in his room. As Melmoth saw
the last blaze, he threw himself into bed,
in hope of a deep and intense sleep. He
had done what was required of him, and
felt exhausted both in mind and body;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_147" title="147"> </a>
but his slumber was not so sound as he
had hoped for. The sullen light of the
turf-fire, burning but never blazing, disturbed
him every moment. He turned
and turned, but still there was the same
red light glaring on, but not illuminating,
the dusky furniture of the apartment.
The wind was high that night, and as the
creaking door swung on its hinges, every
noise seemed like the sound of a hand
struggling with the lock, or of a foot
pausing on the threshold. But (for Melmoth
never could decide) was it in a
dream or not, that he saw the figure of
his ancestor appear at the door?&mdash;hesitatingly
as he saw him at first on the night
of his uncle’s death,&mdash;saw him enter the
room, approach his bed, and heard him
whisper, “You have burned me, then;
but those are flames I can survive.&mdash;I am
alive,&mdash;I am beside you.” Melmoth started,
sprung from his bed,&mdash;it was broad
day-light. He looked round,&mdash;there was
no human being in the room but himself.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_148" title="148"> </a>
He felt a slight pain in the wrist of his
right arm. He looked at it, it was black
and blue, as from the recent gripe of a
strong hand.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="small-caps">The</span> following evening Melmoth retired
early. The restlessness of the preceding
night inclined him to repose, and the
gloom of the day left him nothing to wish
for but its speedy conclusion. It was now
the latter end of Autumn; heavy clouds
had all day been passing laggingly and
gloomily along the atmosphere, as the
hours of such a day pass over the human
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_150" title="150"> </a>
mind and life. Not a drop of rain fell;
the clouds went portentously off, like
ships of war after reconnoitering a strong
fort, to return with added strength and
fury. The threat was soon fulfilled; the
evening came on, prematurely darkened
by clouds that seemed surcharged with a
deluge. Loud and sudden squalls of wind
shook the house from time to time, and
then as suddenly ceased. Towards night
the storm came on in all its strength;
Melmoth’s bed was shaken so as to render
it impossible to sleep. He “liked the
rocking of the battlements,” but by no
means liked the expected fall of the chimneys,
the crashing in of the roof, and the
splinters of the broken windows that were
already scattered about his room. He rose
and went down to the kitchen, where he
knew a fire was burning, and there the
terrified servants were all assembled, all
agreeing, as the blast came roaring down
the chimney, they never had witnessed
such a storm, and between the gusts,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_151" title="151"> </a>
breathing shuddering prayers for those
who were “out at sea that night.” The
vicinity of Melmoth’s house to what sea-men
call an iron-bound coast, gave a dreadful
sincerity to their prayers and their
fears.</p>

<p>In a short time, however, Melmoth perceived
that their minds were occupied
with terrors beside those of the storm.
The recent death of his uncle, and the
supposed visit of that extraordinary being
in whose existence they all firmly believed,
were connected in their minds inseparably
with the causes or consequences of this
tempest, and they whispered their fearful
suggestions to each other, till the sound
reached Melmoth’s ears at every step that
he measured across the broken floor of the
kitchen. Terror is very fond of associations;
we love to connect the agitation of
the elements with the agitated life of man;
and never did a blast roar, or a gleam
of lightning flash, that was not connected
in the imagination of some one,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_152" title="152"> </a>
with a calamity that was to be dreaded,
deprecated, or endured,&mdash;with the fate of
the living, or the destination of the dead.
The tremendous storm that shook all
England on the night of Cromwell’s death,
gave the hint to his puritanic chaplains to
declare, that the Lord had caught him up
in the whirlwind and chariot of fire, even
thereafter, as he caught the prophet Elijah;
while all the cavalier party, putting
their own construction on the matter, proclaimed
their confidence, that the Prince
of the power of the air was vindicating
his right, and carrying off the body of his
victim (whose soul had long been his purchase)
in a tempest, whose wild howl and
triumphant ravage might have been variously,
and with equal justice, interpreted
by each party as giving testimony to
their mutual denunciations. Just such
a party (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mutatis mutandis</i>) were collected
round the bickering fire and rocking chimney
in Melmoth’s kitchen. “He is going
in that blast,” said one of the hags, taking
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_153" title="153"> </a>
the pipe from her mouth, and trying vainly
to rekindle it among the embers that
the storm scattered about like dust; “he
is going in that blast.”&mdash;“He’ll come again,”
cried another Sybil, “he’ll come
again,&mdash;he’s not at rest!&mdash;He roams and
wails about till something is told that he
never could tell in his life-time.&mdash;G-d save
us!” she added, howling up the chimney,
as if addressing the troubled spirit; “tell
us what you want, and <em>stop the blast</em>, will
ye?”&mdash;The wind came like thunder down
the chimney; the hag shuddered and retreated.
“If it’s this you want&mdash;and this&mdash;and
this,” cried a young female whom
Melmoth had not noticed before, “take
them;” and she eagerly tore the papers
out of her hair, and flung them into the
fire. Then Melmoth recollected a ridiculous
story told him the day before of this
girl, who had had the “bad luck,” as she
called it, to curl her hair with some of
the old and useless law-papers of the
family, and who now imagined that they
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_154" title="154"> </a>
“who kept this dreadful pudder o’er her
head,” were particularly provoked by her
still retaining about her whatever belonged
to the deceased; and as she flung the
fragments of paper into the fire, she cried
aloud, “There stop for the holy J<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>s’
sake, and let us have no more about it!&mdash;You
have what you wanted, and will you
have done?” The laugh that Melmoth
could hardly resist, was checked by a sound
which he heard distinctly amid the storm.
“Hush&mdash;silence! that was a signal gun!&mdash;there
is a vessel in distress.” They all
paused and listened. We have already
mentioned the closeness of Melmoth’s abode
to the sea-shore. This had well accustomed
its inmates to all the terrors of
shipwrecked vessels and drowning passengers.
To their honour be it spoken, they
never heard those sounds but as a claim, a
piteous, irresistible claim on their humanity.
They knew nothing of the barbarous
practice on the English coast, of fastening
a lanthorn to the limbs of a spanselled
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_155" title="155"> </a>
horse, whose plungings were to misdirect
the wrecked and sinking wretches,
in the vain hope that the light they saw
was a beacon, and thus to double the horrors
of death by the baffled expectation of
relief.</p>

<p>The party in the kitchen all watched
Melmoth’s countenance intently, as if its
expression could have told them “the secrets
of the hoary deep.” The storm
ceased for a moment, and there was a deep
and dreary silence of fearful expectation.
The sound was heard again,&mdash;it could not
be mistaken. “It is a gun,” cried Melmoth;
“there is a vessel in distress!” and
he hurried out of the kitchen, calling on
the men to follow him.</p>

<p>The men partook eagerly of the excitement
of enterprise and danger. A storm
without doors is, after all, better than a
storm within; without we have something
to struggle with, within we have only to
suffer; and the severest storm, by exciting
the energy of its victim, gives at once a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_156" title="156"> </a>
stimulus to action, and a solace to pride,
which those must want who sit shuddering
between rocking walls, and almost
driven to wish they had only to suffer,
not to fear.</p>

<p>While the men were in search of a
hundred coats, boots, and hats of their
old master, to be sought for in every part
of the house,&mdash;while one was dragging a
great coat from the window, before which
it had long hung as a blind, in total default
of glass or shutters,&mdash;another was snatching
a wig from the jack, where it had been
suspended for a duster,&mdash;and a third was
battling with a cat and her brood of kittens
for a pair of old boots which she had
been pleased to make the seat of her accouchement,&mdash;Melmoth
had gone up to the
highest room in the house. The window
was driven in;&mdash;had there been light, this
window commanded a view of the sea and
the coast. He leaned far out of it, and
listened with fearful and breathless anxiety.
The night was dark, but far off, his sight,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_157" title="157"> </a>
sharpened by intense solicitude, descried a
light at sea. The gust drove him from the
window for a moment; at returning the
next, he saw a faint flash, and then the report
of a gun followed.</p>

<p>There needed no more; and in a few
moments after, Melmoth was on the shore.
Their way was short, and they walked
with their utmost speed; but the violence
of the storm made their progress very
slow, and their anxiety made it seem still
slower. From time to time they said to
each other, in choaked and breathless accents,
“Call up the people in those cabbins&mdash;there
is a light in that house&mdash;they
are all up&mdash;no wonder&mdash;who could sleep
in such a night&mdash;hold the lanthorn low&mdash;it
is impossible to keep footing on the
strand.” “Another gun!” they exclaimed,
as the flash faintly broke through the darkness,
and the heavy sound rolled round the
shore, as if fired over the grave of the sufferers.
“Here’s the rock, hold fast, and
cling together.” They scaled it. “Great
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_158" title="158"> </a>
God!” cried Melmoth, who was among
the first, “what a night! and what a
spectacle!&mdash;Hold up your lanthorns&mdash;do
you hear cries?&mdash;shout to them&mdash;tell
them there is help and hope near them.&mdash;Stay,”
he added, “let me scramble up
that crag&mdash;they will hear my voice from
that.” He dashed desperately through
the water, while the foam of the breakers
from a distant rock almost choaked
him, gained the point, and, elated by
his success, shouted aloud with his utmost
strength. But his voice, baffled and
drowned by the tempest, was lost even to
his own hearing. Its sound was faint and
querulous, more like the wail of grief, than
the encouraging cry of hope. At this moment,
the racking clouds flying rapidly across
the sky, like the scattered fugitives
of a routed army, the moon burst forth
with the sudden and appalling effulgence
of lightning. Melmoth caught a
full view of the vessel, and of her danger.
She lay beating against a rock,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_159" title="159"> </a>
over which the breakers dashed their foam
to the height of thirty feet. She was half
in the water, a mere hulk, her rigging
torn to shreds, her main mast cut away,
and every sea she shipped, Melmoth
could hear distinctly the dying cries of
those who were swept away, or perhaps of
those whose mind and body, alike exhausted,
relaxed their benumbed hold of
hope and life together,&mdash;knew that the next
shriek that was uttered must be their own
and their last. There is something so very
horrible in the sight of human beings perishing
so near us, that we feel one firm
step rightly planted, one arm steadily held
out, might save at least one,&mdash;yet feel we
know not where to fix that step, and
cannot stretch that arm, that Melmoth’s
senses reeled under the shock, and for
a moment he echoed the storm with
yells of actual insanity. By this time
the country, having been alarmed by the
news of a vessel going to pieces on the
shore, had poured down in multitudes;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_160" title="160"> </a>
and those who, from experience or confidence,
or even ignorance, repeated incessantly,
“it is impossible to save her,&mdash;every
soul on board must perish,” involuntarily
quickened their steps as they uttered
the words, as if they were anxious to behold
the fulfilment of their own prediction,
while they appeared hurrying to avert it.</p>

<p>Of one man, in particular, it was observed,
that during their hurried rush to
the shore, he was, with what breath his
haste allowed him, assuring the rest every
moment, “she would be down before they
could get there,” and heard the ejaculations
of “Christ save us! don’t say that,” “No,
please God, we’ll do some good,” with a
laugh almost of triumph. When they arrived,
this man scaled a rock at the risk of
his life, caught a view of the vessel, pointed
out her desperate situation to those below,
and shouted, “Didn’t I tell you so?
wasn’t I right?” And as the storm increased,
his voice was still heard, “wasn’t
I right?” And when the cries of the perishing
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_161" title="161"> </a>
crew were distinctly wafted to
their ears, he was still heard in the interval
repeating, “But wasn’t I right?” Singular
sentiment of pride, that can erect its
trophies amid the grave. ’Tis in this
spirit we give advice to those who suffer
from life, as well as from the elements;
and when the heart of the victim breaks,
console ourselves by exclaiming, “<em>Didn’t
I foretell it all?</em> did I not tell you how it
would be?” It is remarkable that this
man lost his life that very night in the
most <ins title="deperate">desperate</ins> and fruitless attempt to save
the life of one of the crew who was swimming
within six yards of him. The whole
shore was now crowded with helpless gazers,
every crag and cliff was manned; it
seemed like a battle fought at once by sea
and land, between hope and despair. No
effectual assistance could be rendered,&mdash;not
a boat could live in that gale,&mdash;yet
still, and to the last, cheers were heard
from rock to rock,&mdash;terrible cheers, that
announced safety was near and&mdash;<ins title="impossisible">impossible</ins>;&mdash;lanthorns
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_162" title="162"> </a>
held aloft in all directions,
that displayed to the sufferers the shore all
peopled with life, and the roaring and impassable
waves between;&mdash;ropes flung out,
with loud cries of help and encouragement,
and caught at by some chilled, nerveless,
and despairing hand, that only grasped the
wave,&mdash;relaxed its hold,&mdash;was tossed once
over the sinking head,&mdash;and then seen no
more. It was at this moment that Melmoth,
starting from his trance of terror,
and looking round him, saw all, to the
number of hundreds, anxious, restless, and
occupied; and, though obviously in vain,
the sight cheered his heart. “How much
good there is in man,” he cried, “when it
is called forth by the sufferings of his fellows!”
He had no leisure or inclination,
then, to analyse the compound he called
good, and resolve it into its component
parts of curiosity, strong excitement, the
pride of physical strength, or the comparative
consciousness of safety. He had, indeed,
no leisure, for just then he descried,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_163" title="163"> </a>
standing a few yards above him on the
rock, a figure that shewed neither sympathy
or terror,&mdash;uttered no sound,&mdash;offered
no help. Melmoth could hardly keep his
footing on the slippery and rocking crag
on which he stood; the figure, who stood
still higher, appeared alike unmoved by the
storm, as by the spectacle. Melmoth’s
surtout, in spite of his efforts to wrap it
round him, was fluttering in rags,&mdash;not a
thread of the stranger’s garments seemed
ruffled by the blast. But this did not
strike him so much as his obvious insensibility
to the distress and terror around
him, and he exclaimed aloud, “Good
God! is it possible that any thing bearing
the human form should stand there without
making an effort, without expressing
a feeling, for those perishing wretches!”
A pause ensued, or the blast carried away
the sound; but a few moments after, Melmoth
distinctly heard the words, “Let
them perish.” He looked up, the figure
still stood unmoved, the arms folded across
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_164" title="164"> </a>
the breast, the foot advanced, and fixed as
in defiance of the white and climbing spray
of the wave, and the stern profile caught
in the glimpses of the stormy and doubtful
moon-light, seeming to watch the scene
with an expression formidable, revolting,
and unnatural. At this moment, <ins title="at remendous">a tremendous</ins>
wave breaking over the deck of
the hulk, extorted a cry of horror from the
spectators; they felt as if they were echoing
that of the victims whose corses were
in a few moments to be dashed against
their feet, mangled and lifeless.</p>

<p>When the cry had ceased, Melmoth
heard a laugh that chilled his blood. It
was from the figure that stood above him.
Like lightning then glanced on his memory
the recollection of that night in
Spain, when Stanton first encountered that
extraordinary being, whose charmed life,
“defying space and time,” held such fatal
influence over his, and when he first recognised
his supposed demoniac character
by the laugh with which he hailed the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_165" title="165"> </a>
spectacle of the blasted lovers. The echo
of that laugh rung in Melmoth’s ears; he
believed it was indeed that mysterious
being who was standing so near him. His
mind, by its late intense and bewildering
pursuits, at once heated and darkened,
like the atmosphere under an incumbent
thunder-cloud, had now no power of inquiry,
of conjecture, or of calculation. He
instantly began to climb the rock,&mdash;the
figure was but a few feet above him,&mdash;the
object of his daily and nightly dreams
was at last within the reach of his mind
and his arm,&mdash;was almost tangible. <em>Fang</em>
and <em>Snare</em><a name="FootnoteMarker_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="footnote-marker">(12)</a> themselves, in all the enthusiasm
of professional zeal, never uttered,
“If I but once get him within
my vice,” with more eagerness than
did Melmoth, as he scrambled up his
steep and perilous path, to the ledge of
the rock where the figure stood so calm
and dark. Panting from the fury of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_166" title="166"> </a>
storm, the vehemence of his own exertions,
and the difficulty of the task, he
was now almost foot to foot, and face to
face, with the object of his pursuit, when,
grasping at the loosened fragment of a
stone whose fall could not have hurt a
child, though on its tottering insecurity
hung the life-grasp of a man, his hold failed&mdash;he
fell backwards,&mdash;the roaring deep
was beneath, seeming to toss its ten
thousand arms to receive and devour
him. He did not feel the instantaneous
giddiness of his fall, but as he sunk he
felt the splash, he heard the roar. He
was engulphed, then for a moment
thrown to the surface. He struggled with
nothing to grasp at. He sunk with a
vague thought, that if he could reach the
bottom, if he could arrive at any thing
solid, he was safe. Ten thousand trumpets
then seemed to ring in his ears; lights
flashed from his eyes. “He seemed to go
through fire and water,” and remembered
no more till several days afterwards, when
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_167" title="167"> </a>
he found himself in bed, the old gouvernante
beside him, and uttered faintly,
“What a horrid dream!” then sinking
back as he felt his exhaustion, “and how
weak it has left me!”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="small-caps">For</span> some hours after this exclamation,
Melmoth lay silent, his memory returning,&mdash;his
senses gradually defecated,&mdash;the intellectual
lord slowly returning to his abdicated
throne.&mdash;</p>

<p>“I remember all now,” he cried, starting
up in his bed with a sudden vehemence,
that terrified his old nurse with
the apprehension of returning insanity;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_169" title="169"> </a>
but when she approached the bed, candle
in hand, cautiously veiling her eyes with
the other, while she threw the full glare
of the light on the face of the patient, she
saw in a moment the light of sanity in his
eyes, and the strength of health in his
movements. To his eager inquiries of
how he had been saved, how the storm
had terminated, and whether any but himself
had survived the wreck, she could not
deny herself the gratification of answering,
though conscious of his weakness,
and solemnly charged neither to let him
speak or hear, as she valued the recovery
of his reason. She had faithfully observed
the charge for several days,&mdash;a dreadful
trial!&mdash;and now she felt like Fatima in
Cymon, who, when threatened by the
magician with the loss of speech, exclaims,
“Barbarian, will not my death then satisfy
you?”</p>

<p>She began her narrative, the effect of
which was, to lull Melmoth into a profound
repose before half of it was concluded;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_170" title="170"> </a>
he felt the full benefit of the invalids
mentioned in Spenser, who used to
hire Irish story-tellers, and found those indefatigable
persons still pursuing the tale
when they awoke. At first Melmoth listened
with eager attention; soon he was
in the situation of him described by Miss
Baillie,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="no-indent">Soon after his lengthened respiration gave
token that she was only “vexing the dull
ear of a drowsy man;” while, as she closed
the curtain, and shaded the light, the
images of her story were faintly painted
on his dream, that still seemed half a
waking one.</p>

<p>In the morning Melmoth sat up, gazed
round, remembered every thing in a moment,
though nothing distinctly, but felt
the most intense anxiety to see the stranger
saved from the shipwreck, who, he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_171" title="171"> </a>
remembered the gouvernante had told him,
(while her words seemed to falter on the
threshold of his closing senses), was still
alive, and an inmate in his house, but
weak and ill from the bruises he had received,
and the exhaustion and terror he
had undergone. The opinions of the
household on the subject of this stranger
were various. The knowledge of his being
a Catholic had conciliated their hearts,
for the first act of his recovered reason
was to request that a Catholic priest might
be sent for, and the first use of his speech
was to express his satisfaction that he was
in a country where he might enjoy the
benefits of the rites of his own church.
So far all was well; but there was a mysterious
haughtiness and reserve about him,
that somewhat repelled the officious curiosity
of his attendants. He spoke often to
himself in a language they did not understand;
they hoped relief from the priest
on this point, but the priest, after listening
long at the invalid’s door, pronounced
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_172" title="172"> </a>
the language in which he was soliloquizing
<em>not to be Latin</em>, and, after a conversation
of some hours with him, refused to tell
what language the stranger spoke to himself
in, and forbid all inquiry on the subject.
This was bad enough; but, still
worse, the stranger spoke English with
ease and fluency, and therefore could have
no right, as all the household argued, to
torment them with those unknown sounds,
that, sonorous and powerful as they were,
seemed to their ears like an evocation of
some invisible being.</p>

<p>“He asks for what he wants in English,”
said the harassed housekeeper, “and
he can call for candle in English, and he
can say he’ll go to bed in English; and
why the devil can’t he do every thing in
English?&mdash;He can say his prayers too in
English to that picture he’s always pulling
out of his breast and talking to, though
it’s no saint, I am sure, he prays to, (from
the glimpse I got of it), but more like the
devil,&mdash;Christ save us!” All these strange
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_173" title="173"> </a>
rumours, and ten thousand more, were
poured into Melmoth’s ears, fast and faster
than he could receive them. “Is Father
Fay in the house,” said he at last, understanding
that the priest visited the stranger
every day; “if he be, let me see him.”
Father Fay attended him as soon as he
quitted the stranger’s apartment.</p>

<p>He was a grave and decent priest, well
“spoken of by those that were without”
the pale of his own communion; and as
he entered the room, Melmoth smiled at
the idle tattle of his domestics. “I thank
you for your attention to this unfortunate
gentleman, who, I understand, is in my
house.”&mdash;“It was my duty.”&mdash;“I am
told he sometimes speaks in a foreign
tongue.” The priest assented. “Do you
know what countryman he is?” “He is a
Spaniard,” said the priest. This plain,
direct answer, had the proper effect on
Melmoth, of convincing him of its veracity,
and of there being no mystery in the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_174" title="174"> </a>
business, but what the folly of his servants
had made.</p>

<p>The priest proceeded to tell him the
particulars of the loss of the vessel. She
was an English trader bound for Wexford
or Waterford, with many passengers
on board; she had been driven up the
Wicklow coast by stress of weather, had
struck on the night of the 19th October,
during the intense darkness that accompanied
the storm, on a hidden reef of rocks,
and gone to pieces. Crew, passengers, all
had perished, except this Spaniard. It
was singular, too, that this man had saved
the life of Melmoth. While swimming
for his own, he had seen him fall from the
rock he was climbing, and, though his
strength was almost exhausted, had collected
its last remains to preserve the life
of a being who, as he conceived, had been
betrayed into danger by his humanity.
His efforts were successful, though Melmoth
was unconscious of them; and in
the morning they were found on the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_175" title="175"> </a>
strand, locked in each other’s hold, but
stiff and senseless. They shewed some
signs of life when an attempt was made to
remove them, and the stranger was conveyed
to Melmoth’s house. “You owe
your life to him,” said the priest, when he
had ended. “I shall go and thank him
for it this moment,” said Melmoth; but as
he was assisted to rise, the old woman
whispered to him with visible terror, “Jasus’
sake, dear, don’t tell him ye’re a
Melmoth, for the dear life! He has been
as mad as any thing out of Bedlam, since
some jist mintioned the name before him
the ither night.” A sickening recollection
of some parts of the manuscript came
over Melmoth at these words, but he
struggled with himself, and proceeded to
the apartment of the stranger.</p>

<p>The Spaniard was a man about thirty,
of a noble form and prepossessing manners.
To the gravity of his nation was superadded
a deeper tint of peculiar melancholy.
He spoke English fluently; and when
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_176" title="176"> </a>
questioned on it by Melmoth, he remarked
with a sigh, that he had learnt it in a
painful school. Melmoth then changed
the subject, to thank him with earnest
gratitude for the preservation of his life.
“Senhor,” said the Spaniard, “spare me;
if your life was no dearer to you than
mine, it would not be worth thanks.”
“Yet you made the most strenuous exertions
to save it,” said Melmoth. “That
was instinct,” said the Spaniard. “But
you also struggled to save mine,” said
Melmoth. “That was instinct too at the
moment,” said the Spaniard; then resuming
his stately politeness, “or I should say,
the influence of my better genius. I am
wholly a stranger in this country, and
must have fared miserably but for the
shelter of your roof.”</p>

<p>Melmoth observed that he spoke with
evident pain, and he confessed a few moments
afterwards, that though he had
escaped without any serious injury, he had
been so bruised and lacerated, that he still
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_177" title="177"> </a>
breathed with difficulty, and hardly possessed
the use of his limbs. As he concluded
the account of his sufferings during
the storm, the wreck, and the subsequent
struggle for life, he exclaimed in Spanish,
“God! why did the Jonah survive, and
the mariners perish?” Melmoth, imagining
he was engaged in some devotional ejaculation,
was going to retire, when the Spaniard
detained him. “Senhor, I understand
your name is<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>” He paused,
shuddered, and with an effort that seemed
like convulsion, disgorged the name of
Melmoth. “My name is Melmoth.”
“Had you an ancestor, a very remote
one, who was&mdash;at a period perhaps beyond
family-tradition<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>It is useless to inquire,”
said the Spaniard, covering his face
with both his hands, and groaning aloud.
Melmoth listened in mingled excitement
and terror. “Perhaps, if you would proceed,
I could answer you&mdash;go on, Senhor.”
“Had you,” said the Spaniard, forcing
himself to speak, abruptly and rapidly,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_178" title="178"> </a>
“had you, then, a relative who was, about
one hundred and forty years ago, said to
be in Spain.” “I believe&mdash;yes, I fear&mdash;I
had.” “It is enough, Senhor&mdash;leave me&mdash;to-morrow
perhaps&mdash;leave me now.”
“It is impossible to leave you now,” said
Melmoth, catching him in his arms before
he sunk on the floor. He was not senseless,
for his eyes were rolling with terrible
expression, and he attempted to articulate.
They were alone. Melmoth, unable to
quit him, called aloud for water; and
while attempting to open his vest, and
give him air, his hand encountered a miniature
portrait close to the heart of the
stranger. As he touched it, his touch
operated on the patient with all the force
of the most powerful restorative. He
grasped it with his own cold hand with a
force like that of death, and muttered in
a hollow but thrilling voice, “What have
you done?” He felt eagerly the ribbon
by which it was suspended, and, satisfied
that his terrible treasure was safe, turned
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_179" title="179"> </a>
his eyes with a fearful calmness of expression
on Melmoth, “You know all, then?”&mdash;“I
know nothing,” said Melmoth faultering.
The Spaniard rose from the
ground, to which he had almost fallen,
disengaged himself from the arms that
supported him, and eagerly, but staggeringly,
hurrying towards the candles, (it
was night), held up the portrait full before
Melmoth’s eye. It was a miniature likeness
of that extraordinary being. It was
painted in a coarse and unartist-like style,
but so faithfully, that the pencil appeared
rather held by the mind than by the
fingers.</p>

<p>“Was he&mdash;was the original of this&mdash;your
ancestor?&mdash;Are you his descendant?&mdash;Are
you the depository of that terrible
secret which<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>” He again fell to the
ground convulsed, and Melmoth, for whose
debilitated state this scene was too much,
was removed to his own apartment.</p>

<p>It was several days before he again saw
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_180" title="180"> </a>
his visitor; his manner was then calm and
collected, till he appeared to recollect the
necessity of making an apology for his
agitation at their last meeting. He began&mdash;hesitated&mdash;stopped;
tried in vain to arrange
his ideas, or rather his language;
but the effort so obviously renewed his
agitation, that Melmoth felt an exertion
on his part necessary to avert its consequences,
and began most inauspiciously to
inquire into the motive of his voyage to
Ireland. After a long pause, the Spaniard
said, “That motive, Senhor, a few
days past I believed it was not in mortal
power to compel me to disclose. I deemed
it incommunicable as it was incredible.
I conceived myself to be alone on the
earth, without sympathy and beyond relief.
It is singular that accident should
have placed me within the reach of the
only being from whom I could expect
either, and perhaps a developement of
those circumstances which have placed me
in a situation so extraordinary.” This exordium,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_181" title="181"> </a>
delivered with a composed but
thrilling gravity, had an effect on Melmoth.
He sat down and prepared to
listen, and the Spaniard began to speak;
but after some hesitation, he snatched the
picture from his neck, and trampling on it
with true continental action, exclaimed,
“Devil! devil! thou choakest me!” and
crushing the portrait, glass and all, under
his feet, exclaimed, “Now I am easier.”</p>

<p>The room in which they sat was a low,
mean, wretchedly furnished apartment;
the evening was tempestuous, and as the
windows and doors rattled in the blast,
Melmoth felt as if he listened to some
herald of “fate and fear.” A deep and
sickening agitation shook his frame; and
in the long pause that preceded the narrative
of the Spaniard, the beating of his
heart was audible to him. He rose, and
attempted to arrest the narration by a motion
of his hand; but the Spaniard mistook
this for the anxiety of his impatience,
and commenced his narrative, which, in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_182" title="182"> </a>
mercy to the reader, we shall give without
the endless interruptions, and queries, and
anticipations of curiosity, and starts of
terror, with which it was broken by Melmoth.</p>

<div class="section">

<h3 id="Tale_of_the_Spaniard">Tale of the Spaniard.</h3>

</div>

<p>“<span class="small-caps">I am</span>, Senhor, as you know, a native
of Spain, but you are yet to learn I am a
descendant of one of its noblest houses,&mdash;a
house of which she might have been
proud in her proudest day,&mdash;the house of
Monçada. Of this I was not myself conscious
during the first years of my life;
but during those years, I remember experiencing
the singular contrast of being
treated with the utmost tenderness, and
kept in the most sordid privacy. I lived
in a wretched house in the suburbs of Madrid
with an old woman, whose affection
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_183" title="183"> </a>
for me appeared prompted as much by interest
as inclination. I was visited every
week by a young cavalier and a beautiful
female; they caressed me, called me their
beloved child, and I, attached by the grace
with which my young father’s <i lang="es" xml:lang="es">capa</i> was
folded, and my mother’s veil adjusted, and
by a certain air of indescribable superiority
over those by whom I was surrounded,
eagerly returned their caresses, and petitioned
them to take me <em>home</em> with them;
at these words they always wept, gave a
valuable present to the woman I lived
with, whose attention was always redoubled
by this expected stimulant, and departed.</p>

<p>“I observed their visits were always short,
and paid late in the evening; thus a shadow
of mystery enveloped my infant days,
and perhaps gave its lasting and ineffaceable
tinge to the pursuits, the character,
and the feelings of my present existence.
A sudden change took place;&mdash;one day
I was visited, splendidly dressed, and
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_184" title="184"> </a>
carried in a superb vehicle, whose motion
made me giddy with novelty and surprise,
to a palace whose front appeared to
me to reach the heavens. I was hurried
through several apartments, whose splendour
made my eyes ache, amid an army of
bowing domestics, to a cabinet where sat an
old nobleman, whom, from the tranquil majesty
of his posture, and the silent magnificence
that surrounded him, I felt disposed
to fall down and worship as we do those
saints, whom, after traversing the aisles of
an immense church, we find niched in some
remote and solitary shrine. My father and
mother were there, and both seemed awed
by the presence of that aged vision, pale
and august; their awe increased mine, and
as they led me to his feet, I felt as if about
to be sacrificed. He embraced me, however,
with some reluctance and more austerity;
and when this ceremony was performed,
during which I trembled, I was
removed by a domestic, and conducted to
an apartment where I was treated like the
son of a grandee; in the evening I was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_185" title="185"> </a>
visited by my father and mother; they shed
tears over me as they embraced me, but I
thought I could perceive they mingled
the tears of grief with those of fondness.
Every thing around appeared so strange,
that perhaps I felt something appropriate in
this change. I was so much altered myself,
that I expected an alteration in others, and
the reverse would have struck me as a phenomenon.</p>

<p>“Change followed change with such rapidity,
that it produced on me an effect like
that of intoxication. I was now twelve
years old, and the contracted habits of my
<ins title="earily">early</ins> life had had their usual effect, of exalting
my imagination, while they impaired
every other faculty. I expected an adventure
whenever the door opened, and that
was but seldom, to announce the hours of
devotion, food, and exercise. On the third
day after I was received into the palace of
Monçada, the door was opened at an unusual
hour, (a circumstance that made me
tremble with anticipation), and my father
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_186" title="186"> </a>
and mother, attended by a number of domestics,
entered, accompanied by a youth
whose superior height and already distinguished
figure, made him appear my senior,
though he was in fact a year younger.</p>

<p>“Alonzo,” said my father to me, “embrace
your brother.” I advanced with all
the eagerness of youthful affection, that
feels delight from new claims on its store,
and half wishes those new claims were endless;
but the slow step of my brother, the
measured air with which he extended his
arms, and declined his head on my left
shoulder for a moment, and then raising it,
viewed me with eyes in whose piercing and
haughty lustre there was not one beam of
fraternity, repelled and disconcerted me.
We had obeyed our father, however,
and embraced. “Let me see you hand in
hand together,” said my father, as if he
would have enjoyed the sight. I held out
my hand to my brother, and we stood thus
linked for a few moments, my father and
mother remaining at some distance to gaze
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_187" title="187"> </a>
on us; during these <em>few</em> moments, I had
leisure to glance from my parents to my
brother, and judge of the comparative effect
our appearance thus contrasted might
produce on them. The contrast was by
no means favourable to me. I was tall,
but my brother was much taller; he had an
air of confidence, of conquest I might say;
the brilliancy of his complexion could be
equalled only by that of his dark eyes,
which turned from me to our parents, and
seemed to say, “Chuse between us, and reject
me if you dare.”</p>

<p>“My father and mother advanced and
embraced us both. I clung round their
necks; my brother submitted to their caresses
with a kind of proud impatience, that
seemed to demand a more marked recognition.</p>

<p>“I saw no more of them,&mdash;that evening
the whole household, which perhaps contain
two hundred domestics, were in despair.
The Duke de Monçada, that awful vision
of anticipated mortality whom I had seen
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_188" title="188"> </a>
but once, was dead. The tapestry was torn
from the walls; every room was filled with
ecclesiastics; I was neglected by my attendants,
and wandered through the spacious
rooms, till I by chance lifted up a curtain of
black velvet, and saw a sight which, young
as I was, paralyzed me. My father and
mother, dressed in black, sat beside a figure
which I believed to be my grandfather
asleep, but his sleep was very profound;
my brother was there too, in a mourning
dress, but its strange and grotesque disfigurement
could not conceal the impatience
with which he wore it, and the flashing
eagerness of his expression, and the
haughty brilliancy of his eye, shewed a kind
of impatience of the part he was compelled
to act.&mdash;I rushed forward;&mdash;I was withheld
by the domestics;&mdash;I asked, “Why am I
not permitted to be here, where my
younger brother is?” An ecclesiastic drew
me from the apartment. I struggled with
him, and demanded, with an arrogance
which suited my pretensions better than
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_189" title="189"> </a>
my prospects, “Who I was?” “The
grandson of the late Duke of Monçada,”
was the answer. “And why am I thus
treated?” To this no answer. I was conveyed
to my apartment, and closely watched
during the interment of the Duke of
Monçada. I was not permitted to attend
his funeral. I saw the splendid
and melancholy cavalcade depart from
the palace. I ran from window to window
to witness the funeral pomp, but
was not allowed to accompany it. Two
days after I was told a carriage waited for
me at the gate. I entered it, and was conveyed
to a convent of Ex-Jesuits, (as they
were well known to be, though no one in
Madrid dared to say so), where an agreement
had been made for my board and
education, and where I became an inmate
that very day. I applied myself to my
studies, my teachers were pleased, my parents
visited me frequently, and gave the
usual marks of affection, and all was well;
till one day as they were retiring, I heard
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_190" title="190"> </a>
an old domestic in their suite remark, how
singular it was, that the eldest son of the
(now) Duke de Monçada should be educated
in a convent, and brought up to a
monastic life, while the younger, living in
a superb palace, was surrounded by teachers
suited to his rank. The word “monastic
life” thrilled in my ears; it furnished me
with an interpretation not only of the indulgence
I had experienced in the convent,
(an indulgence quite inconsistent with the
usual severity of their discipline), but of
the peculiar language in which I had been
always addressed by the Superior, the brethren,
and the boarders. The former, whom
I saw once a week, bestowed the most flattering
praises on the progress I had made
in my studies, (praises that covered me with
blushes, for I well knew it was very moderate
compared with that of the other boarders),
and then gave me his benediction,
but never without adding, “My God!
thou wilt not suffer this lamb to wander
from thy fold.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_191" title="191"> </a><ins title="The">“The</ins> brethren always assumed before me
an air of tranquillity, that eulogized their
situation more powerfully than the most
exaggerated eloquence. The petty squabbles
and intrigues of the convent, the bitter
and incessant conflict of habits, tempers,
and interests, the efforts of incarcerated
minds for objects of excitement,
the struggles to diversify endless monotony,
and elevate hopeless mediocrity;&mdash;all
that makes monastic life like the wrong
side of tapestry, where we see only uncouth
threads, and the harsh outlines, without
the glow of the colours, the richness of
the tissue, or the splendour of the embroidery,
that renders the external surface so
rich and dazzling; all this was carefully
concealed. I heard something of it, however,
and, young as I was, could not help
wondering how men who carried the worst
passions of life into their retreat, could
imagine <em>that</em> retreat was a refuge from the
erosions of their evil tempers, the monitions
of conscience, and the accusations of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_192" title="192"> </a>
God. The same dissimulation was practised
by the boarders; the whole house was
in masquerade from the moment I entered
it. If I joined the latter at the time of recreation,
they went through the few amusements
allowed them with a kind of
languid impatience, as if it was an interruption
of better pursuits to which they
were devoted. One of them, coming up
to me, would say, “What a pity that
these exercises are necessary for the support
of our frail nature! what a pity we
cannot devote its whole powers to the service
of God!” Another would say, “I
never am so happy as in the choir! What
a delightful eulogy was that pronounced
by the Superior on the departed Fre Jose!
How thrilling was that requiem! I imagined
the heavens opened, and angels
descending to receive his soul, as I listened
to it!”</p>

<p>“All this, and much more, I had been
accustomed to hear every day. I now began
to understand it. I suppose they
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_193" title="193"> </a>
thought they had a very weak person to
deal with; but the bare-faced coarseness of
their manœuvres only quickened my penetration,
which began to be fearfully
awake. I said to them, “Are you, then,
intended for the monastic life?” “We
hope so.” “Yet I have heard you, Oliva,
<em>once</em> (it was when you did not think I
overheard you) I heard you complain of
the length and tediousness of the homilies
delivered on the eves of the saints.”&mdash;“I
was then under the influence of the evil
spirit doubtless,” said Oliva, who was a
boy not older than myself; “Satan is
sometimes permitted to buffet those whose
vocation is but commencing, and whom
he is therefore more afraid to lose.” “And
I have heard you, Balcastro, say you had
not taste for music; and to me, I confess,
that of the choir appears least likely to
inspire a taste for it.” “God has touched
my heart since,” replied the young hypocrite,
crossing himself; “and you know,
friend of my soul, there is a promise, that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_194" title="194"> </a>
the ears of the deaf shall be opened.”
“Where are those words?” “In the
Bible.” “The Bible?&mdash;But we are not
permitted to read it.” “True, dear Monçada,
but we have the word of our Superior
and the brethren for it, and that is
enough.” “Certainly; our spiritual guides
must take on themselves the whole responsibility
of that state, whose enjoyments
and punishments they reserve in their own
hands; but, Balcastro, are you willing to
take this life on their word, as well as the
next, and resign it before you have tried
it?” “My dear friend, you only speak
to tempt me.” “<em>I do not speak to tempt</em>,”
said I, and was turning indignantly away,
when the bell ringing, produced its usual
effect on us all. My companions assumed
a more sanctified air, and I struggled for a
more composed one.</p>

<p><ins title="As">“As</ins> we went to the church, they conversed
in whispers, but those whispers
were intended to reach my ear. I could
hear them say, “It is in vain that he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_195" title="195"> </a>
struggles with grace; there never was a
more decided vocation; God never obtained
a more glorious victory. Already
he has the look of a child of heaven;&mdash;the
monastic gait,&mdash;the downcast look;&mdash;the
motion of his arms naturally imitates the
sign of the cross, and the very folds of his
mantle arrange themselves, by a divine
instinct, into those of a Monk’s habit.”
And all this while my gait was disturbed,
my countenance flushed, and often lifted
to heaven, and my arms employed in
hastily adjusting my cloak, that had fallen
off my shoulder from my agitation, and
whose disordered folds resembled any thing
but those of a Monk’s habit. From that
evening I began to perceive my danger,
and to meditate how to avert it. I
had no inclination for the monastic life;
but after vespers, and the evening exercise
in my own cell, I began to doubt
if this very repugnance was not itself a
sin. Silence and night deepened the impression,
and I lay awake for many hours,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_196" title="196"> </a>
supplicating God to enlighten me, to enable
me not to oppose his will, but clearly
to reveal that will to me; and if he was
not pleased to call me to a monastic life,
to support my resolution in undergoing
every thing that might be inflicted on me,
sooner than profane that state by extorted
vows and an alienated mind. That my
prayers might be more effectual, I offered
them up first in the name of the Virgin,
then in that of the Patron-saint of the
family, and then of the Saint on whose
eve I was born. I lay in great agitation
till morning, and went to matins without
having closed my eyes, I had, however,
I felt, acquired <em>resolution</em>,&mdash;at least
I thought so. Alas! I knew not what
I had to encounter. I was like a man
going to sea with a day’s provision, and
imagining he is victualled for a voyage
to the poles. I went through my exercises
(as they were called) with uncommon assiduity
that day; already I felt the necessity
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_197" title="197"> </a>
of imposition,&mdash;fatal lesson of monastic institutions.
We dined at noon; and soon
after my father’s carriage arrived, and I
was permitted to go for an hour on the
banks of the Manzanares. To my surprise
my father was in the carriage, and though
he welcomed me with a kind of embarrassment,
I was delighted to meet him.
He was a layman at least,&mdash;<em>he might have
a heart</em>.</p>

<p><ins title="I">“I</ins> was disappointed at the measured
phrase he addressed me in, and this froze
me at once into a rigid determination, to
be as much <em>on my guard with him</em>, as I
must be within the walls of the convent.
The conversation began, “You like your
convent, my son?” “Very much,” (there
was not a word of truth in my answer, but
the fear of circumvention always teaches
falsehood, and we have only to thank our
instructors). “The Superior is very fond
of you.” “He seems so.” “The brethren
are attentive to your studies, and capable
of directing them, and appreciating your
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_198" title="198"> </a>
progress.” “They seem so.” “And the
boarders&mdash;they are sons of the first families
in Spain, they appear all satisfied with
their situation, and eager to embrace its
advantages.” “They seem so.” <ins title="My">“My</ins> dear
son, why have you thrice answered me in
the same monotonous, unmeaning phrase?”
“Because I thought it all <em>seeming</em>.” “How,
then, would you say that the devotion of
those holy men, and the profound attention
of their pupils, whose studies are alike
beneficial to man, and redounding to the
glory of the church to which they are dedicated&mdash;”
“My dearest father,&mdash;I say
nothing of them,&mdash;but <em>I dare</em> to speak of
myself,&mdash;I can never be a monk,&mdash;if that
is your object&mdash;spurn me,&mdash;order your
lacqueys to drag me from this carriage,&mdash;leave
me a beggar in the streets to cry
<a name="FootnoteMarker_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="footnote-marker">(13)</a>“<em>fire and water</em>,”&mdash;but do not make me
a monk.” My father appeared stunned
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_199" title="199"> </a>
by this apostrophe. He did not utter a
word. He had not expected such a premature
developement of the secret which
he imagined <em>he</em> had to disclose, not to hear
disclosed. At this moment the carriage
turned into the <em>Prado</em>; a thousand magnificent
equipages, with plumed horses, superb
caparisons, and beautiful women bowing
to the cavaliers, who stood for a moment
on the foot-board, and then bowed their
adieus to the “ladies of their love,” passed
before our eyes. I saw my father, at this
moment, arrange his superb mantle, and the
silk net in which his long black hair was
bound, and give the signal to his lacqueys
to stop, that he might mingle among the
crowd. I caught this moment,&mdash;I grasped
his mantle.&mdash;“Father, you find this world
delightful then,&mdash;would you ask me to
resign it,&mdash;me,&mdash;who am your child.”&mdash;“But
you are too young for it, my son.”
“Oh, then, my father, I am surely much
<em>too young for another world</em>, to which you
would force me.” “Force you, my child,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_200" title="200"> </a>
my first-born!” And these words he uttered
with such tenderness, that I involuntarily
kissed his hands, while his lips
eagerly pressed my forehead. It was at
this moment that I studied, with all the
eagerness of hope, my father’s physiognomy,
or what artists would call his <em>physique</em>.</p>

<p>“He had been my parent before he was
sixteen; his features were beautiful, his
figure the most graceful and lover-like I
ever beheld, and his early marriage had
preserved him from all the evils of youthful
excess, and spared the glow of feature,
and elasticity of muscle, and grace of juvenility,
so often withered by vice, almost
before they have bloomed. He was now
but twenty-eight, and looked ten years
younger. He was evidently conscious of
this, and as much alive to the enjoyments
of youth, as if he were still in its spring.
He was at the same moment rushing into
all the luxuries of youthful enjoyment and
voluptuous splendour, and dooming one,
who was at least young enough to be his
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_201" title="201"> </a>
son, to the frozen and hopeless monotony
of a cloister. I laid hold of this with the
grasp of a drowning man. But a drowning
man never grasped a straw so weak as
he who depends on the worldly feeling of
another for the support of his own.</p>

<p>“Pleasure is very selfish; and when selfishness
pleads to selfishness for relief, it is
like a bankrupt asking his fellow-prisoner
to go bail for him. This was my conviction
at the moment, yet still I reflected,
(for suffering supplies the place of experience
in youth, and they are most expert
casuists who have graduated only in the
school of misfortune), I reflected, that a
taste for pleasure, while it renders a man
selfish in one sense, renders him generous
in another. The real voluptuary, though
he would not part with his slightest indulgence
to save the world from destruction,
would yet wish all the world to be
enjoying itself, (provided it was not at his
expence), because his own would be increased
by it. To this I clung, and intreated
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_202" title="202"> </a>
my father to indulge me with another
view of the brilliant scene before us.
He complied, and his feelings, softened by
this compliance, and exhilarated by the
spectacle, (which interested <em>him</em> more than
me, who observed it only for its effect on
him), became more favourable than ever.
I availed myself of this, and, while returning
to the convent, threw the whole power
of my nature and intellect into one (almost)
shrieking appeal to his heart. I compared
myself to the unhappy Esau, deprived of
his birthright by a younger brother, and I
exclaimed in his language, “Hast thou no
blessing for me! Bless me, even me also,
Oh my father!” My father was affected;
he promised my intreaty every consideration;
but he hinted some difficulty to be
encountered on my mother’s part, much
on that of her Director, who (I afterwards
found) governed the whole family, and
still more remotely hinted at something
insurmountable and inexplicable. He suffered
me, however, to kiss his hand at
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_203" title="203"> </a>
parting, and vainly struggled with his
emotions when he felt it damp with my
tears.</p>

<p>“It was not till two days after, that I
was summoned to attend my mother’s Director,
who was waiting for me in the
parlour. I deemed this delay the result
of a long family debate, or (as it seemed to
me) conspiracy; and I tried to prepare
myself for the multifarious warfare in
which I had now to engage with parents,
directors, superiors, and monks, and boarders,
all sworn to win the day, and not
caring whether they carried their point by
storm, sap, mine, or blockade. I began to
measure the power of the assailants, and to
try to furnish myself with weapons suited
to their various modes of attack. My father
was gentle, flexible, and vacillating.
I had <em>softened</em> him in my favour, and I
felt that was all that could be done with
him. But the Director was to be encountered
with different arms. As I went
down to the parlour, I composed my looks,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_204" title="204"> </a>
my gait, I modulated my voice, I adjusted
my dress. I was on my guard, body,
mind, mien, clothes, every thing. He was
a grave, but mild-looking ecclesiastic; one
must have had the treachery of Judas to
suspect him of treachery. I felt disarmed,
I even experienced some compunction.
“Perhaps,” said I, “I have all this while
armed myself against a message of reconciliation.”
The Director began with some
trifling inquiries about my health, and my
progress in study, but he asked them in
a tone of interest. I said to myself, it
would not be decorous for him to enter on
the subject of his visit too soon;&mdash;I answered
him calmly, but my heart palpitated
with violence. A silence ensued, and then
suddenly turning towards me, he said,
“My dear child, I understand your objections
to a monastic life are insurmountable.
I do not wonder at it; its habits must appear
very unconciliating to youth, and, in
fact, I know not to what period of life abstinence,
privation, and solitude, are particularly
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_205" title="205"> </a>
agreeable; it was the wish of your
parents doubtless; but”&mdash;This address, so
full of candour, almost overpowered me;
caution and every thing else forsook me as
I exclaimed, “But what then, my father?”
“But, I was going to observe, how rarely
our own views coincide with those which
others entertain for us, and how difficult
it is to decide which are the least erroneous.”
“Was that all?” said I, shrinking with
disappointment. “That was all; for instance,
some people, (of whom I once happened
to be one), might be fanciful enough
to imagine, that the superior experience
and proved affection of parents should
qualify them to decide on this point better
than their children; nay, I have heard
some carry their absurdity so far, as to talk
of the rights of nature, the obligations of
duty, and the useful coercion of restraint;
but since I had the pleasure of becoming
acquainted with your resolution, I am beginning
to be of opinion, that a youth, not
thirteen years of age, may be an incomparable
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_206" title="206"> </a>
judge in the last resort, particularly
when the question bears a trifling relation
to his eternal as well as temporal interest;
in such a case, he has doubtless the double
advantage of dictating both to his spiritual
and natural parents.” “My father, I
beg you to speak without irony or ridicule;
you may be very clever, but I merely
wish you to be intelligible and serious.”
“Do you wish me, then, to speak seriously?”
and he appeared to <em>collect</em> himself as
he asked this question. “Certainly.” “Seriously,
then, my dear child, do you not
believe that your parents love you? Have
you not received from your infancy every
mark of affection from them? Have you
not been pressed to their bosoms from
your very cradle?” At these words I
struggled vainly with my feelings, and
wept, while I answered, “Yes.” “I am
sorry, my dear child, to see you thus overpowered;
my object was to appeal to your
reason, (for you have no common share of
reasoning power),&mdash;and to your reason I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_207" title="207"> </a>
appeal;&mdash;can you suppose that parents, who
have treated you with such tenderness,
who love you as they do their own souls,
could act (as your conduct charges them)
with causeless and capricious cruelty towards
you? Must you not be aware there
is a reason, and that it must be a profound
one? Would it not be more worthy of
your duty, as well as your superior sense,
to inquire into, than contend with it?” “Is
it founded upon any thing in my conduct,
then?&mdash;I am willing to do every
thing,&mdash;to sacrifice every thing.”&mdash;“I understand,&mdash;you
are willing to do every
thing but what is required of you,&mdash;and to
sacrifice every thing but your own inclination.”
“But you have hinted at a reason.”
The Director was silent. “You urged
me to inquire into it.” The Director was
silent still. “My father, I adjure you, by
the habit you wear, unmuffle this terrible
phantom to me; there is nothing I cannot
encounter”&mdash;“Except the commands of your
parents. But am I at liberty to discover
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_208" title="208"> </a>
this secret to you?” said the Director, in a
tone of internal debate. “Can I imagine
that you, who have in the very outset outraged
parental authority, will revere parental
feelings?” “My father, I do not
understand you.” “My dear child, I am
compelled to act with a caution and reserve
unsuited to my character, which is
naturally as open as yours. I dread the
disclosure of a secret; it is repugnant to
my habits of profound confidence; and I
dread disclosing any thing to a character
impetuous like yours. I feel myself reduced
to a most painful situation.” “My
father, act and speak with candour, my situation
requires it, and your own profession
demands it from you. My father, remember
the inscription over the confessional
which thrilled my very blood to
read, “God hears thee.” Remember
God hears you always, and will you not
deal sincerely with one whom God has
placed at your mercy?” I spoke with
much agitation, and the Director appeared
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_209" title="209"> </a>
affected for a moment; that is, he passed
his hand over his eyes, which were as dry
as&mdash;his heart. He paused for several minutes,
and then said, “My dear child, dare
I trust you? I confess I came prepared
to treat you like a boy, but I feel I am
disposed to consider you as a man. You
have the intelligence, the penetration, the
decision of a man. Have you the feelings
of one?” “Try me, my father.” I did
not perceive that his irony, his <em>secret</em>, and
his parade of feeling, were all alike theatrical,
and substitutionary for real interest
and sincerity. “If I should be inclined
to trust you, my dear child,”&mdash;“I
shall be grateful.” “And secret.”
“And secret, my father.” “Then imagine
yourself”&mdash;“Oh! my father, let me not
have to <em>imagine</em> any thing&mdash;tell me the
truth.” “Foolish boy,&mdash;am I then so bad
a painter, that I must write the name under
the figure.” “I understand you, my father,
and shall not interrupt you again.”
“Then imagine to yourself the honour of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_210" title="210"> </a>
one of the first houses in Spain; the peace
of a whole family,&mdash;the feelings of a father,&mdash;the
honour of a mother,&mdash;the interests of
religion,&mdash;the eternal salvation of an individual,
all suspended in one scale. What
do you think could outweigh them?”
“Nothing,” I replied ardently. “Yet, in
the opposite scale you throw <em>nothing</em>,&mdash;the
caprice of a boy not thirteen years old;&mdash;this
is all you have to oppose to the claims
of nature, of society, and of God.” “My
father, I am penetrated with horror at what
you have said,&mdash;does all this depend on
me?” “It does,&mdash;it does all depend on
you.” “But how, then,&mdash;I am bewildered,&mdash;I
am willing to make a sacrifice,&mdash;tell
me what I am to do.” “Embrace, my
dear child, the monastic life; this will accomplish
the views of all who love you,
ensure your own salvation, and fulfil the
will of God, who is calling you at this
moment by the voices of your affectionate
parents, and the supplications of the minister
of heaven, who is now kneeling before
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_211" title="211"> </a>
you.” And he sunk on his knees
before me.</p>

<p>“This prostration, so unexpected, so revolting,
and so like the monastic habit of
artificial humiliation, completely annihilated
the effect of his language. I retreated
from his arms, which were extended
towards me. “My father, <em>I cannot</em>,&mdash;I
will never become a monk.” “Wretch!
and you refuse, then, to listen to the call
of your conscience, the adjuration of your
parents, and the voice of God?” The fury
with which he uttered these words,&mdash;the
change from a ministering angel to an infuriated
and menacing demon, had an
effect just contrary to what he expected.
I said calmly, “My conscience does not
reproach me,&mdash;I have never disobeyed
its calls. My parents have adjured me
only through your mouth; and I hope,
for their sakes, the organ has not been inspired
by them. And the voice of God,
echoed from my own heart, bids me not
to obey you, by adulterating his service
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_212" title="212"> </a>
with prostituted vows.” As I spoke thus,
the Director changed the whole character
of his figure, his attitude, and his language;&mdash;from
the extreme of supplication
or of terror, he passed in a moment, with
the facility of an actor, to a rigid and
breathless sternness. His figure rose from
the ground before me like that of the Prophet
Samuel before the astonished eyes of
Saul. He dropt the dramatist, and was
the monk in a moment. “And you will
not take the vows?” “I will not, my
father.” “And you will brave the resentment
of your parents, and the denunciations
of the church.” “I have done nothing
to deserve either.” “But you will
encounter both, to cherish your horrid resolution
of being the enemy of God.”
“I am not the enemy of God for speaking
the truth.” “Liar and hypocrite, you
blaspheme!” “Stop, my father, these are
words unbecoming your profession, and
unsuited to this place.” “I acknowledge
the justice of the rebuke, and submit to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_213" title="213"> </a>
it, though uttered by the mouth of a
child.”&mdash;And he dropped his hypocritical
eyes, folded his hands on his breast, and
murmured, “Fiat voluntas tua. My dear
child, my zeal for the service of God, and
the honour of your family, to which I am
attached equally by principle and affection,
have carried me too far,&mdash;I confess it; but
have I to ask pardon of you also, my
child, for a redundance of that affection
and zeal for your house, which its descendant
has proved himself destitute of?”
The mingled humiliation and irony of this
address had no effect on me. He saw it had
not; for after slowly raising his eyes to
watch that effect, he saw me standing in
silence, not trusting my voice with a word,
lest I should utter something rash and disrespectful,&mdash;not
daring to lift up my eyes,
lest their expression should speak without
making language necessary.</p>

<p>“I believe the Director felt his situation
rather critical; his interest in the family
depended on it, and he attempted to cover
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_214" title="214"> </a>
his retreat with all the expertness and fertility
of manœuvre which belong to an
ecclesiastical tactician. “My dear child,
we have been both wrong, I from zeal,
and you from&mdash;no matter what; our business
is to exchange forgiveness with each
other, and to implore it of God, whom we
have both offended. My dear child, let
us prostrate ourselves before him, and even
while our hearts are glowing with human
passion, God may seize that moment to
impress the seal of his grace on both, and
fix it there for ever. Often the earthquake
and the whirlwind are succeeded by the
still, small voice, and God is there.&mdash;Let
us pray.” I fell on my knees, resolved to
pray in my heart; but in a short time, the
fervour of his language, the eloquence and
energy of his prayers, dragged me along
with him, and I felt myself compelled to
pray against every dictate of my own
heart. He had reserved this display for
the last, and he had judged well. I never
heard any thing so like inspiration; as I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_215" title="215"> </a>
listened, and involuntarily, to effusions
that seemed to issue from no mortal lips,
I began to doubt my own motives, and
search my heart. I had disdained his
taunts, I had defied and conquered his
passion, but as he prayed, I wept. This
going over the same ground with the
heart, is one of the most painful and humiliating
of all exercises; the virtue of
yesterday becomes the vice of to-day; we
ask with the desponding and restless scepticism
of Pilate, “What is truth?” but
the oracle that was so eloquent one moment,
is dumb the next, or if it answers,
it is with that ambiguity that makes us
dread we have to consult again&mdash;again&mdash;and
for ever&mdash;in vain.</p>

<p><ins title="I">“I</ins> was now in a state quite fit for the Director’s
purpose; but he was fatigued with
the part he had played with so little success,
and took his leave, imploring me to
continue my importunities to Heaven to
direct and enlighten me, while he himself
would supplicate all the saints in heaven
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_216" title="216"> </a>
to touch the hearts of my parents, and reveal
to them some means of saving me
from the crime and perjury of a forced
vocation, without <em>involving themselves in
a crime, if possible, of blacker dye and
greater magnitude</em>. Saying so he left me,
to urge my parents, with all his influence,
to pursue the most rigorous measures to
enforce my adoption of the conventual
life. His motives for doing so were sufficiently
strong when he visited me, but their
strength was increased tenfold before his
departure. He had reckoned confidently
on the power of his remonstrances; he
had been repulsed; the disgrace of such a
defeat rankled in the core of his heart.
He had been only a <em>partizan</em> in the cause,
but he was now a <em>party</em>. What was a
matter of conscience before, was now a
matter of honour with him; and I rather
believe that the Director laid a greater
stress on the latter, or made a great havock
of confusion between both in his mind.
Be that as it may, I passed a few days
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_217" title="217"> </a>
after his visit in a state of indescribable
excitement. I had something to hope,
and that is often better than something to
enjoy. The cup of hope always excites
thirst, that of fruition disappoints or
quenches it. I took long walks in the
garden alone. I framed imaginary conversations
to myself. The boarders observed
me, and said to each other, according
to their instructions, “He is meditating
on his vocation, he is supplicating for
illuminating grace, let us not disturb him.”
I did not undeceive them; but I reflected
with increasing horror on a system that
<em>forced</em> hypocrisy to a precocity unparalleled,
and made the last vice of life the earliest
of conventual youth. But I soon forgot
reflection, to plunge into reverie. I
imagined myself at the palace of my father;
I saw him, my mother, and the Director,
engaged in debate. I spoke for
each, and felt for all. I supplied the passionate
eloquence of the Director, his
strong representations of my aversion to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_218" title="218"> </a>
the habit, his declaration that further importunity
on their part would be as impious
as it was fruitless. I saw all the impression
I once flattered myself I had made
on my father revived. I saw my mother
yield. I heard the murmur of doubtful
acquiescence,&mdash;the decision, the congratulations.
I saw the carriage approaching,&mdash;I
heard the convent doors fly open. Liberty,&mdash;liberty,&mdash;I
was in their arms; no,
I was at their feet. Let those who smile
at me, ask themselves whether they have
been indebted most to imagination or reality
for all they have enjoyed in life, if indeed
they have ever enjoyed any thing.
In these internal dramas, however, I always
felt that the persons did not speak
with the interest I wished; and the speeches
I put into their mouths would have been
spoken with ten thousand times more
animation by myself. Still I felt the
most exquisite enjoyment in these reveries,
and perhaps it was not diminished by
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_219" title="219"> </a>
the thought how I was deceiving my companions
the whole time. But dissimulation
always teaches dissimulation; and the
only question is, whether we shall be the
masters of the art or its victims? a question
soon decided by our self-love.</p>

<p>“It was on the sixth day that I heard,
with a beating heart, a carriage stop. I
could have sworn to the sound of its
wheels. I was in the hall before I was
summoned. I felt I could not be in the
wrong, nor was I. I drove to my father’s
palace in a delirium,&mdash;a vision of repulse
and of reconciliation, of gratitude and of
despair. I was ushered into a room, where
were assembled my father, my mother, and
the Director, all seated, and silent as statues.
I approached, I kissed their hands,
and then stood at a small distance breathless.
My father was the first to break silence,
but he spoke very much with the
air of a man who was repeating a part
dictated to him; and the tone of his voice
contradicted every word he <em>prepared</em> to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_220" title="220"> </a>
utter. “My son, I have sent for you, no
longer to contend with your weak and
wicked obstinacy, but to announce to you
my own resolution. The will of Heaven
and of your parents has devoted you to
its service, and your resistance can only
make us miserable, without in the least
frustrating that resolution.” At these
words, gasping for breath, my lips involuntarily
unclosed; my father imagined
this was an attempt to reply, though in
fact I was not capable of uttering a syllable,
and hastened to prevent it. “My
son, all opposition is unavailing, all discussion
fruitless. Your destiny is decided,
and though your struggles may render it
wretched, they cannot reverse it. Be reconciled,
my child, to the will of Heaven
and your parents, which you may insult,
but cannot violate. This reverend person
can better explain to you the necessity of
your obedience than I can.” And my father,
evidently weary of a task which he
had reluctantly undertaken, was rising to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_221" title="221"> </a>
go away, when the Director detained him.
“Stay, Senhor, and assure your son before
you depart, that, since I last saw him,
I have fulfilled my promise, and urged
every topic on your mind, and that of the
duchess, that I thought might operate for
his <em>best interests</em>.” I was aware of the
hypocritical ambiguity of this expression;
and, collecting my breath, I said, “Reverend
father, as a son I seek not to employ
an intercessor with my own parents. I
stand before them, and if I have not an
intercessor in their hearts, your mediation
must be ineffectual altogether. I implored
you merely to state to them my invincible
reluctance.” They all interrupted me with
exclamations, as they repeated my last
words,&mdash;“Reluctance! invincible! Is it
for this you have been admitted to our
presence? Is it for this we have borne so
long with your contumacy, only to hear it
repeated with aggravations?” “Yes, my
father,&mdash;yes, for this or nothing. If I am
not permitted to speak, why am I suffered
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_222" title="222"> </a>
in your presence?” “Because we hoped
to witness your submission.” “Allow me
to give the proofs of it on my knees;”&mdash;and
I fell on my knees, hoping that my
posture might soften the effect of the
words I could not help uttering. I kissed
my father’s hand,&mdash;he did not withdraw
it, and I felt it tremble. I kissed the
skirt of my mother’s robe,&mdash;she attempted
to withdraw it with one hand, but with
the other she hid her face, and I thought
I saw tears bursting through her fingers.
I knelt to the Director too, and besought
his benediction, and struggled, though
with revolting lips, to kiss his hand; but
he snatched his habit from my hand, elevated
his eyes, spread out his fingers, and
assumed the attitude of a man who recoils
in horror from a being who merits the extreme
of malediction and reprobation.
Then I felt my only chance was with my
parents. I turned to them, but they
shrunk from me, and appeared willing to
devolve the remainder of the task on the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_223" title="223"> </a>
Director. He approached me. “My
child, you have pronounced your reluctance
to <em>the life of God</em> invincible, but
may there not be things more invincible
even to your resolution? The curses of
that God, confirmed by those of your parents,
and deepened by all the fulminations
of the church, whose embraces you
have rejected, and whose holiness you
have desecrated by that rejection.” “Father,
these are terrible words, but I have
no time now but for meanings.” “Besotted
wretch, I do not understand you,&mdash;you
do not understand yourself.” “Oh!
I do,&mdash;I do!” I exclaimed. And turning
to my father, still on my knees, I cried,
“My dear father, is life,&mdash;human life, all
shut up from me?” “It is,” said the Director,
answering for my father. “Have
I no resource?” “None.” “No profession?”
“<em>Profession!</em> degenerate wretch!”
“Let me embrace the meanest, but
do not make me a monk.” “Profligate
as weak.” “Oh! my father,” still calling
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_224" title="224"> </a>
on my father, “let not this man answer
for you. Give me a sword,&mdash;send
me into the armies of Spain to seek death,&mdash;death
is all I ask, in preference to that
life you doom me to.” “It is impossible,”
said my father, gloomily returning from
the window against which he had been
leaning; “the honour of an illustrious family,&mdash;the
dignity of a Spanish grandee&mdash;”
“Oh! my father, of how little value will
that be, when I am consuming in my early
grave, and you die broken-hearted on it,
over the flower your own voice has doomed
to wither there.” My father trembled.
“Senhor, I entreat,&mdash;I command you to
retire; this scene will unfit you for the devotional
duties you must perform this
evening.” “And you leave me then?” I
cried as they departed. “Yes,&mdash;yes,”&mdash;repeated
the Director; “leave you burdened
with the curse of your father.” “Oh
no!” exclaimed my father; but the Director
had hold of his hand, and pressed it
strongly. “Of your mother,” he repeated.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_225" title="225"> </a>
I heard my mother weep aloud, and
felt it like a repeal of that curse; but she
dared not speak, and I could not. The
Director had now two victims in his hands,
and the third at his feet. He could not
avoid showing his triumph. He paused,
collected the full power of his sonorous
voice, and thundered forth, “And of God!”
And as he rushed from the room, accompanied
by my father and mother, whose
hands he grasped, I felt as if struck by a
thunderbolt. The rushing of their robes,
as he dragged them out, seemed like the
whirlwind that attends the presence of the
destroying angel. I cried out, in my hopeless
agony of destitution, “Oh! that my
brother were here to intercede for me,”&mdash;and,
as I uttered these words, I fell. My
head struck against a marble table, and I
sunk on the floor covered with blood.</p>

<p>“The domestics (of whom, according
to the custom of the Spanish nobility,
there were about two hundred in the
palace) found me in this situation. They
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_226" title="226"> </a>
uttered outcries,&mdash;assistance was procured,&mdash;it
was believed that I had attempted
to kill myself; but the surgeon who
attended me happened to be a man both
of science and humanity, and having
cut away the long hair clotted with blood,
and surveyed the wound, he pronounced
it trifling. My mother was of his opinion,
for within three days I was summoned to
her apartment. I obeyed the summons.
A black bandage, severe head-ache, and an
unnatural paleness, were the only testimonies
of my accident, as it was called;
and the Director had suggested to her that
this was the time to <span class="small-caps all-upper">FIX THE IMPRESSION</span>.
How well religious persons understand the
secret of making every event of the present
world operate on the future, while
they pretend to make the future predominate
over the present. Were I to outlive
the age of man, I should never forget my
interview with my mother. She was alone
when I entered, and seated with her back
to me. I knelt and kissed her hand. My
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_227" title="227"> </a>
paleness and my submission seemed to affect
her,&mdash;but she struggled with her emotions,
overcame them, and said in a cold
<em>dictated</em> tone, “To what purpose are those
marks of exterior reverence, when your
heart disowns them?” “Madam, I am not
conscious of that.” “Not conscious! How
then are you here? How is it that you
have not, long before this, spared your father
the shame of supplicating his own
child,&mdash;the shame, still more humiliating,
of supplicating him in vain; spared the
Father Director the scandal of seeing the
authority of the church violated in the
person of its minister, and the remonstrances
of duty as ineffectual as the calls
of nature? And me,&mdash;oh! why have you
not spared me this hour of agony and
shame?” and she burst into a flood of tears,
that drowned my soul as she shed them.
“Madam, what have I done that deserves
the reproach of your tears? My disinclination
to a monastic life is no crime?”
“In you it is a crime.” “But how then,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_228" title="228"> </a>
dear mother, were a similar choice offered
to my brother, would his rejection of it
be deemed a crime?” I said this almost involuntarily,
and merely by way of comparison.
I had no ulterior meaning, nor
the least idea that one could be developed
by my mother, except a reference to an
unjustifiable partiality. I was undeceived,
when she added, in a voice that chilled my
blood, “There is a great difference between
you.” “Yes, Madam, he is your favourite.”
“No, I take Heaven to witness,&mdash;no;”
and she, who had appeared so severe,
so decisive, and so impenetrable before, uttered
these words with a sincerity that penetrated
to the bottom of my heart;&mdash;she appeared
to be appealing to Heaven against
the prejudices of her child. I was affected&mdash;I
said, “But, Madam, this difference
of circumstances is inexplicable.” “And
would you have it explained <em>by me</em>?” “By
any one, Madam.” “<em>By me!</em>” she repeated,
not hearing me; then kissing a
crucifix than hung on her bosom, “My
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_229" title="229"> </a>
God! the chastisement is just, and I submit
to it, though inflicted by my own
child. You are illegitimate,” she added,
turning suddenly towards me; “you are
illegitimate,&mdash;your brother is not; and
your intrusion into your father’s house is
not only its disgrace, but a perpetual monitor
of that crime which it aggravates
without absolving.” I stood speechless.
“Oh! my child,” she continued, “have
mercy on your mother. Has not this confession,
extorted from her by her own son,
been sufficient to expiate her offence?”
“Go on, Madam, I can bear any thing
now.” “You must bear it, for you have
forced me to this disclosure. I am of rank
far inferior to your father,&mdash;you were our
first child. He loved me, and forgiving
my weakness as a proof of my devotion
to him, we were married, and your brother
is our lawful child. Your father,
anxious for my reputation, since I was
united to him, agreed with me, as our
marriage was private, and its date uncertain,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_230" title="230"> </a>
that you should be announced as our
legitimate offspring. For years your
grandfather, incensed at our marriage, refused
to see us, and we lived in retirement,&mdash;would
that I had died there. A few
days before his death he relented, and sent
for us; it was no time to acknowledge the
imposition practised on him, and you were
introduced as the child of his son, and the
heir of his honours. But from that hour I
have never known a moment’s peace. The
lie I had dared to utter before God and the
world, and to a dying parent,&mdash;the injustice
done to your brother,&mdash;the violation of natural
duties and of legal claims,&mdash;the convulsions
of my conscience, that heavily upbraided
me, not only with vice and perjury,
but with sacrilege.” “Sacrilege!” “Yes;
every hour you delay the assumption of
the habit is a robbery of God. Before you
were born, I devoted you to him, as the
only expiation of my crime. While I yet
bore you in my bosom without life, I dared
to implore his forgiveness only on the condition
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_231" title="231"> </a>
of your future intercession for me as
a minister of religion. <em>I relied on your
prayers before you could speak.</em> I proposed
to intrust my penitence to one, who, in
becoming the child of God, had atoned for
<em>my</em> offence in making him the child of sin.
In imagination I knelt already at your
confessional,&mdash;heard you, by the authority
of the church, and the commission of
Heaven, pronounce me forgiven. I saw
you stand beside my dying bed,&mdash;I felt
you press the cross to my cold lips, and
point to that heaven where I hoped my
vow had already secured a seat for you.
Before your birth I had laboured to lift
you to heaven, and my recompence is,
that your obstinacy threatens to drag us
both into the gulph of perdition. Oh! my
child, if our prayers and intercessions are
available to the delivery of the souls of our
departed relatives from punishment, hear
the adjuration of a living parent, who implores
you not to seal her everlasting condemnation!”
I was unable to answer, my
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_232" title="232"> </a>
mother saw it, and redoubled her efforts.
“My son, if I thought that my kneeling
at your feet would soften your obduracy,
I would prostrate myself before them
this moment.” “Oh! madam, the sight
of such unnatural humiliation ought to
kill me.” “And yet you will not yield&mdash;the
agony of this confession, the interests
of my salvation and your own, nay, the
preservation of my life, are of no weight
with you.” She perceived that these
words made me tremble, and repeated,
“Yes, my life; beyond the day that your
inflexibility exposes me to infamy, I will
not live. If you have resolution, I have
resolution too; nor do I dread the result,
for God will charge on your soul, not on
mine, the crime an unnatural child has
forced me to&mdash;and yet you will not yield.&mdash;Well,
then, the prostration of my body is
nothing to that prostration of soul you
have already driven me to. I kneel to my
own child for life and for salvation,” and
she knelt to me. I attempted to raise her;
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_233" title="233"> </a>
she repelled me, and exclaimed, in a voice
hoarse with despair, “And you will not
yield?” “I do not say so.” “And what,
then, do you say?&mdash;raise me not, approach
me not, till you answer me.” “That I
will think.” “Think! you must decide.”
“I do, then, I do.” “But how?” “To
be whatever you would have me.” As I
uttered these words, my mother fell in a
swoon at my feet. As I attempted to lift
her up, scarce knowing if it was not a corse
I held in my arms, I felt I never could
have forgiven myself if she had been reduced
to that situation by my refusing
to comply with her last request. *
* * * *</p>

<p><ins title="I">“I</ins> was overpowered with congratulations,
blessings, and embraces. I received
them with trembling hands, cold lips, a
rocking brain, and a heart that felt turned
to stone. Every thing passed before
me as in a dream. I saw the pageant
move on, without a thought of who was
to be the victim. I returned to the convent&mdash;I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_234" title="234"> </a>
felt my destiny was fixed&mdash;I had
no wish to avert or arrest it&mdash;I was like
one who sees an enormous engine (whose
operation is to crush him to atoms) put
in motion, and, stupified with horror,
gazes on it with a calmness that might
be mistaken for that of one who was
coolly analysing the complication of its
machinery, and calculating the resistless
crush of its blow. I have read of a
wretched Jew<a name="FootnoteMarker_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="footnote-marker">(14)</a>, who, by the command of
a Moorish emperor, was exposed in an
area to the rage of a lion who had been
purposely kept fasting for eight and forty
hours. The horrible roar of the famished
and infuriated animal made even the executioners
tremble as they fastened the rope
round the body of the screaming victim.
Amid hopeless struggles, supplications for
mercy, and shrieks of despair, he was
bound, raised, and lowered into the area.
At the moment he touched the ground,
he fell prostrate, stupefied, annihilated.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_235" title="235"> </a>
He uttered no cry&mdash;he did not draw a
breath&mdash;he did not make an effort&mdash;he
fell contracting his whole body into a ball,
and lay as senseless as a lump of earth.&mdash;So
it fared with me; my cries and struggles
were over,&mdash;I had been flung into the
area, and I lay there. I repeated to myself,
“I am to be a monk,” and there the
debate ended. If they commended me for
the performance of my exercises, or reproved
me for my deficiency, I showed
neither joy nor sorrow,&mdash;I said only, “I
am to be a monk.” If they urged me to
take exercise in the garden of the convent,
or reproved me for my excess in walking
beyond the allotted hours, I still answered,
“I am to be a monk.” I was
showed much indulgence in these wanderings.
A son&mdash;the eldest son of the Duke
de Monçada, taking the vows, was a glorious
triumph for the ex-Jesuits, and they
did not fail to make the most of it. They
asked what books I would like to read,&mdash;I
answered, “What they pleased.” They
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_236" title="236"> </a>
saw I was fond of flowers, and vases of
porcelain, filled with the most exquisite
produce of their garden, (renewed every
day), embellished my apartment. I was
fond of music,&mdash;that they perceived from
my involuntary joining in the choir. My
voice was good, and my profound melancholy
gave an expression to my tones,
which these men, always on the watch to
grasp at any thing that may aggrandize
them, or delude their victims, assured me
were like the tones of inspiration.</p>

<p>“Amid these displays of indulgence,
I exhibited an ingratitude totally foreign
from my character. I never read
the books they furnished me with,&mdash;I
neglected the flowers with which they
filled my room,&mdash;and the superb organ
they introduced into my apartment, I
never touched, except to elicit some
deep and melancholy chords from its
keys. To those who urged me to employ
my talents for painting and music, I still
answered with the same apathetic monotony,
“I am to be a monk.” “But, my
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_237" title="237"> </a>
brother, the love of flowers, of music,
of all that can be consecrated to God,
is also worthy of the attention of man&mdash;you
abuse the indulgence of the Superior.”
“Perhaps so.” “You must,
in gratitude to God, thank him for these
lovely works of his creation;”&mdash;the room
was at this time filled with carnations and
roses;&mdash;“you must also be grateful to him
for the powers with which he has distinguished
you in hymning his praises&mdash;your
voice is the richest and most powerful
in the church.” “I don’t doubt it.” “My
brother, you answer at random.” “Just
as I feel&mdash;but don’t heed that.” “Will you
take a turn in the garden?” “If you
please.” “Or will you seek a moment’s
consolation from the Superior?” “If you
please.” “But why do you speak with
such apathy? are the odour of the flowers,
and the consolations of your Superior, to be
appreciated in the same breath?” “I believe
so.” “Why?” “Because I am to
be a monk.” “Nay, brother, will you
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_238" title="238"> </a>
never utter any thing but that phrase,
which carries no meaning with it but that
of stupefaction or delirium?” “Imagine
me, then, stupefied, delirious&mdash;what you
please&mdash;you know I must be a monk.”
At these words, which I suppose I uttered
in a tone unlike that of the usual <em>chaunt</em>
of monastic conversation, another interposed,
and asked what I was uttering in
so loud a key? “I am only saying,” I replied,
“that I must be a monk.” “Thank
God it is no worse,” replied the querist,
“your contumacy must long ago have
wearied the Superior and the brethren&mdash;thank
God it’s no worse.” At these words
I felt my passions resuscitated,&mdash;I exclaimed,
“<em>Worse!</em> what have I to dread?&mdash;am
I not to be a monk?” From that evening,
(I forget when it occurred), my liberty was
abridged; I was no longer suffered to walk,
to converse with the boarders or novices,&mdash;a
separate table was spread for me in the
refectory,&mdash;the seats near mine were left
vacant at service,&mdash;yet still my cell was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_239" title="239"> </a>
embellished with flowers and engravings,
and exquisitely-wrought toys were left on
my table. I did not perceive they were
treating me as a lunatic, yet certainly
my foolishly reiterated expressions might
have justified them in doing so,&mdash;they had
their own plans in concert with the Director,&mdash;my
silence went for proof. The Director
came often to visit me, and the hypocritical
wretches <em>would</em> accompany him
to my cell. I was generally (for want of
other occupation) attending to my flowers,
or gazing at the engravings,&mdash;and they
would say, “You see he is as happy as he
wishes to be&mdash;he wants for nothing&mdash;he is
quite occupied in watching those roses.”
“No, I am not occupied,” I returned, “it
is occupation I want.” Then they shrugged
their shoulders, exchanged mysterious
looks with the Director, and I was glad
when they were gone, without reflecting
on the mischief their absence threatened
me with. At this moment, consultation after
consultation was held at the palace de
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_240" title="240"> </a>
Monçada, whether I could be induced to
shew sufficient intellect to enable me to
pronounce the vows. It seems the reverend
fathers were as anxious as their old
enemies the Moors, to convert an idiot into
a saint. There was now a party combined
against me, that it would have required
more than the might of man to resist.
All was uproar from the palace de Monçada
to the convent, and back again. I
was mad, <em>contumacious</em>, heretical, idiotical,&mdash;any
thing&mdash;every thing&mdash;that could appease
the jealous agony of my parents, the
cupidity of the monks, or the ambition of
the ex-Jesuits, who laughed at the terror
of all the rest, and watched intently over
their own interests. Whether I was mad
or not, they cared very little; to enroll a
son of the first house of Spain among their
converts, or to imprison him as a madman,
or to exorcise him as a demoniac, was all
the same to them. There was a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de
theatre</i> to be exhibited, and provided they
played first parts, they cared little about
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_241" title="241"> </a>
the catastrophe. Luckily, during all this
uproar of imposture, fear, falsehood, and
misrepresentation, the Superior remained
steady. He let the tumult go on, to aggrandize
his importance; but he was resolved
all the time that I should have sanity
enough to enable me to take the vows.
I knew nothing of all this, but was astonished
at being summoned to the parlour
on the last eve of my noviciate. I had
performed my religious exercises with regularity,
had received no rebukes from
the master of the novices, and was totally
unprepared for the scene that awaited me.
In the parlour were assembled my father,
mother, the Director, and some other persons
whom I did not recognize. I advanced
with a calm look, and equal step.
I believe I was as much in possession of
my reason as any one present. The Superior,
taking my arm, led me round the
room, saying, “You see<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>” I interrupted
him&mdash;“Sir, what is this intended
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_242" title="242"> </a>
for?” He answered only by putting
his finger on his lips, and then desired me
to exhibit my drawings. I brought
them, and offered them on one knee, first
to my mother, and then to my father.
They were sketches of monasteries and
prisons. My mother averted her eyes&mdash;and
my father said, pushing them away,
“I have no taste in those things.”
“But you are fond of music doubtless,”
said the Superior; “you must hear his
performance.” There was a small organ
in the room adjacent to the parlour; my
mother was not admitted there, but my
father followed to listen. Involuntarily I
selected an air from the “Sacrifice of
Jephtha.” My father was affected, and bid
me cease. The Superior imagined this
was not only a tribute to my talent, but
an acknowledgement of the power of his
party, and he applauded without measure
or judgement. Till that moment, I had
never conceived I could be the object of a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_243" title="243"> </a>
party in the convent. The Superior was
determined to make me a Jesuit, and
therefore was pledged for my <em>sanity</em>. The
monks wished for an exorcism, an <i>auto
de fe</i>, or some such bagatelle, to diversify
the dreariness of monasticism, and therefore
were anxious I should be, or appear,
deranged or possessed. Their pious wishes,
however, failed. I had appeared when summoned,
<em>behaved</em> with scrupulous correctness,
and the next day was appointed for
my taking the vows.</p>

<p>“That next day&mdash;Oh! that I could describe
it!&mdash;but it is impossible&mdash;the profound
stupefaction in which I was plunged
prevented my noticing things which
would have inspired the most uninterested
spectator. I was so absorbed, that though
I remember facts, I cannot paint the slightest
trace of the feelings which they excited.
During the night I slept profoundly, till I
was awoke by a knock at my door.&mdash;“My
dear child, how are you employed?” I knew
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_244" title="244"> </a>
the voice of the Superior, and I replied,
“My father, I was sleeping.” “And I
was macerating myself at the foot of the
altar for you, my child,&mdash;the scourge is
red with my blood.” I returned no answer,
for I felt the maceration was better
merited by the betrayer than the betrayed.
Yet I was mistaken; for in fact, the Superior
felt some compunction, and had undergone
this penance on account of my repugnance
and alienation of mind, more
than for his own offences. But Oh! <em>how
false is a treaty made with God, which we
ratify with our own blood</em>, when he has
declared there is but one sacrifice he will
accept, even that of the Lamb slain from
the foundation of the world! Twice in
the night, I was thus disturbed, and twice
answered in the same language. The Superior,
I make no doubt, was sincere. He
thought he was doing all for God, and his
bleeding shoulders testified his zeal. But
I was in such a state of mental ossification,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_245" title="245"> </a>
that I neither felt, heard, or understood;
and when he knocked a second and third
time at the door of my cell to announce
the severity of his macerations, and the efficacy
of his intercessions with God, I answered,
“Are not criminals allowed to
sleep the night before their execution?”
At hearing these words, which must have
made him shudder, the Superior fell
prostrate before the door of my cell,
and I turned to sleep again. But I could
hear the voices of the monks as they
raised the Superior, and bore him to his
cell. They said, “He is incorrigible&mdash;you
humiliate yourself in vain&mdash;when he is
<em>ours</em>, you shall see him a different being&mdash;he
shall then prostrate himself before you.”
I heard this, and slept on. The morning
came&mdash;I knew what it would bring&mdash;I
dramatized the whole scene in my own
mind. I imagined I witnessed the tears
of my parents, the sympathy of the congregation.
I thought I saw the hands
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_246" title="246"> </a>
of the priests tremble as they tossed the
incense, and even the acolytes shiver as
they held their robes. Suddenly my mind
changed: I felt&mdash;what was it I felt?&mdash;a
union of malignity, despair, and power,
the most formidable. Lightning seemed
flashing from my eyes as I reflected,&mdash;I
might make the sacrificers and the sacrificed
change places in one moment,&mdash;I
might blast my mother as she stood, by a
word,&mdash;I might break my father’s heart,
by a single sentence,&mdash;I might scatter
more desolation around me, than it was
apparently possible for human vice, human
power, or human malignity, more potent
than both, to cause to its most abject victim.&mdash;Yes!&mdash;on
that morning I felt within
myself the struggles of nature, feeling,
compunction, pride, malevolence, and despair.&mdash;The
former I had brought with me,
the latter had been all acquired in the convent.
I said to those who attended me
that morning, “You are arraying me for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_247" title="247"> </a>
a victim, but I can turn the executioners
into the victims if I please”&mdash;and I laughed.
The laugh terrified those who were
about me&mdash;they retreated&mdash;they represented
my state to the Superior. He came
to my apartment. The whole convent was
by this time alarmed&mdash;their credit was at
stake&mdash;the preparations had all been made&mdash;the
whole world was determined I was
to be a monk, mad or not.</p>

<p>“The Superior was terrified, I saw, as
he entered my apartment. “My son,
what means all this?” “Nothing, my father&mdash;nothing
but a sudden thought that
has struck me.” “We will discuss it another
time, my son; at present&mdash;” “<em>At
present</em>,” I repeated with a laugh that
must have lacerated the Superior’s ears&mdash;“At
present I have but one alternative to
propose&mdash;let my father or my brother take
my place&mdash;that is all. I will never be a
monk.” The Superior, at these words, ran
in despair round the cell. I followed him,
exclaiming, in a voice that must have filled
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_248" title="248"> </a>
him with horror, “I exclaim against the
vows&mdash;let those who forced me to it, take
the guilt on themselves&mdash;let my father, in
his own person, expiate his guilt in bringing
me into the world&mdash;let my brother sacrifice
his pride&mdash;why must I be the only victim
of the crime of the one, and the passions
of the other?” “My son, all this was arranged
before.” “Yes, I know that&mdash;I
know that by a decree of the Almighty I
was doomed to be cursed even in my mother’s
womb, but I will never subscribe that
decree with my own hand.” “My son,
what can I say to you&mdash;you have passed
your noviciate.” “Yes, in a state of stupefaction.”
“All Madrid is assembled to
hear you take your vows.” “Then all
Madrid shall hear me renounce them, and
disavow them.” “This is the very day
fixed on. The ministers of God are prepared
to yield you to his arms. Heaven
and earth,&mdash;all that is valuable in time, or
precious in eternity, are summoned, are
waiting for the irrevocable words that seal
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_249" title="249"> </a>
your salvation, and ensure that of those
you love. What demon has taken possession
of you, my child, and seized the
moment you were coming to Christ, to
cast you down, and tear you? How shall
I&mdash;how shall the fraternity, and all the
souls who are to escape from punishment
by the merit of your prayers, answer to
God for your horrible apostacy?” “Let
them answer for themselves&mdash;let every one
of us answer for ourselves&mdash;that is the dictate
of reason.” “Of reason, my deluded
child,&mdash;when had reason any thing to do
with religion?” I had sat down, folded
my arms on my breast, and forbore to answer
a word. The Superior stood with
his arms crossed, his head declined, his
whole figure in an air of profound and
mortified contemplation. Any one else
would have imagined him seeking God in
the abysses of meditation, but I felt he was
only seeking him where he is never to be
found,&mdash;in the abyss of that heart which is
“deceitful and desperately wicked.” He
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_250" title="250"> </a>
approached&mdash;I exclaimed, “Come not near
me!&mdash;you will renew again the story of
my submission&mdash;I tell you it was artificial;&mdash;of
my regularity in devotional exercises&mdash;it
was all mechanism or imposture;&mdash;of my
conformity to discipline&mdash;it was all practised
with the hope of escaping from it ultimately.
Now, I feel my conscience discharged
and my heart lightened. Do you
hear, do you understand me? These are
the first words of truth I ever uttered since I
entered these walls&mdash;the only ones that will,
perhaps, ever be uttered within them&mdash;aye,
treasure them up, knit your brows, and
cross yourself, and elevate your eyes as
you will. Go on with your religious
drama. What is there you see before you
so horrible, that you recoil, that you cross
yourself, that you lift your eyes and hands
to heaven?&mdash;a creature whom despair has
driven to utter desperate truth! Truth
may be horrible to the inmates of a convent,
whose whole life is artificial and
perverted,&mdash;whose very hearts are sophisticated
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_251" title="251"> </a>
beyond the hand even of Heaven
(which they alienate by their hypocrisy)
to touch. But I feel I am at this moment
an object of less horror in the sight of
the Deity, than if I were standing at his
altar, to (as you would urge me) insult him
with vows, which my heart was bursting
from my bosom to contradict, at the moment
I uttered them.”</p>

<p>“At these words, which I must have
uttered with the most indecent and insulting
violence, I almost expected the Superior
would have struck me to the earth,&mdash;would
have summoned the lay-brothers to
bear me to confinement,&mdash;would have shut
me up in the dungeon of the convent, for
I knew there was such a place. Perhaps
I wished for all this. Driven to extremity
myself, I felt a kind of pride in driving
others to it in return. Any thing of violent
excitement, of rapid and giddy vicissitude,
or even of intense suffering, I was
prepared for, and equal to, at that moment.
But these paroxysms soon exhaust
themselves and us by their violence.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_252" title="252"> </a>Astonished by the Superior’s silence, I
raised my eyes to him. I said, in a tone
of moderation that seemed unnatural to
my own ears, “Well, let me hear my
sentence.” He was silent still. He had
<em>watched the crisis</em>, and now skilfully seized
the turn of the mental disease, to exhibit
his applications. He was standing
before me meek and motionless, his arms
crossed, his eyes depressed, not the slightest
indication of resentment to be traced
in his whole figure. The folds of his habit,
refusing to announce his internal agitation,
seemed as they were cut out of
stone. His silence imperceptibly softened
me,&mdash;I blamed myself for my violence.
Thus men of the world command
us by their passions, and men of the other
world by the apparent suppression of them.
At last he said, “My son, you have revolted
from God, resisted his Holy Spirit,
profaned his sanctuary, and insulted his
minister,&mdash;in his name and my own I forgive
you all. Judge of the various characters
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_253" title="253"> </a>
of our systems, by their different
results on us two. You revile, defame,
and accuse,&mdash;I bless and forgive; which of
us is then under the influence of the gospel
of Christ, and within the pale of the
church’s benediction? But leaving this
question, which you are not at present in
a frame to decide, I shall urge but one topic
more; if that fails, I shall no longer
oppose your wishes, or urge you to prostitute
a sacrifice which man would despise,
and God must disdain. I add, I will even
do my utmost to facilitate your wishes,
which are now in fact my own.” At these
words, so full of truth and benignity, I
was rushing to prostrate myself at his feet,
but fear and experience checked me, and
I only bowed. “Promise me merely that
you will wait with patience till this last
topic is urged; whether it succeeds or not
I have now little interest, and less care.” I
promised,&mdash;he went out. A few moments
after he returned. His air was a little
more disturbed, but still struggling for a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_254" title="254"> </a>
calmness of expression. There was agitation
about him, but I knew not whether
it was felt on his own account or mine.
He held the door half open, and his first
sentence astonished me.&mdash;“My son, you
are well acquainted with the classical histories.”
“But what is that to the purpose,
my father?” “You remember a remarkable
story of the Roman general, who
spurned from the steps of his tribune,
people, senators, and <em>priests</em>,&mdash;trampled
on all law,&mdash;outraged all religion,&mdash;but
was at last moved by nature, for, when
his mother prostrated herself before him,
and exclaimed, ‘My son, before you tread
the streets of Rome, you must first tread
on the body of her who bore you!’ he relented.”
“I remember all, but to what
does this tend?” “<em>To this</em>,” and he threw
open the door; “now, prove yourself, if
you can, more obdurate than a heathen.”
As the door opened, across the threshold
lay my mother, prostrate on her face.
She said in a stifled voice, “Advance,&mdash;break
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_255" title="255"> </a>
your vows,&mdash;but you must rush to
perjury over the body of your mother.”
I attempted to raise her, but she clung to
the ground, repeating the same words;
and her magnificent dress, that overspread
the floor of stone with gems and velvet,
frightfully contrasted her posture of humiliation,
and the despair that burned in
her eyes, as she raised them to me for a
moment. Convulsed with agony and horror,
I reeled into the arms of the Superior,
who seized that moment to bear me to the
church. My mother followed,&mdash;the ceremony
proceeded. I vowed chastity, poverty,
and obedience, and in a few moments
my destiny was decided. *
* * * *</p>

<p>“Day followed day for many a month,
of which I have no recollections, nor wish
to have any. I must have experienced
many emotions, but they all subsided like
the waves of the sea under the darkness of
a midnight sky,&mdash;their fluctuation continues,
but there is no light to mark their
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_256" title="256"> </a>
motion, or trace when they rise and fall.
A deep stupor pervaded my senses and
soul; and perhaps, in this state, I was best
fitted for the monotonous existence to
which I was doomed. It is certain that I
performed all the conventual functions
with a regularity that left nothing to be
blamed, and an apathy that left nothing
for praise. My life was a sea without a
tide. The bell did not toll for service with
more mechanical punctuality than I obeyed
the summons. No automaton, constructed
on the most exquisite principles
of mechanism, and obeying those principles
with a punctuality almost miraculous,
could leave the artist less room for complaint
or disappointment, than I did the
Superior and community. I was always
first in my place in the choir. I received
no visits in the parlour,&mdash;when I was permitted
to go, I declined the permission.
If penance was enjoined, I submitted; if
relaxation was permitted, I never partook
of it. I never asked a dispensation from
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_257" title="257"> </a>
morning prayers, or from vigils. I was
silent in the refectory,&mdash;in the garden I
walked alone. I neither thought, nor felt,
nor lived,&mdash;if life depends on consciousness,
and the motions of the will. I slept
through my existence like the Simorgh in
the Eastern fable, but this sleep was not
to last long. My abstraction and calmness
would not do for the Jesuits. My stupor,
my noiseless tread, my fixed eyes, my
ghastly silence, might indeed have impressed
a superstitious community with
the idea that it was no human creature
who stalked through their cloisters, and
haunted their choir. But they had quite
different ideas. They considered all this
as a tacit reproach to the struggles, the
squabbles, the intrigues, and the circumventions,
in which they were immersed,
body and soul, from morn till night. Perhaps
they thought I was lying in reserve,
only to watch them. Perhaps there might
have been a dearth of some matter of curiosity
or complaint in the convent just then,&mdash;a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_258" title="258"> </a>
very little serves for either. However it
was, they began to revive the old story of
my being deranged, and resolved to make
the most of it. They whispered in the refectory,
consulted in the garden,&mdash;shook their
heads, pointed at me in the cloister, and finally,
I faithfully believe, worked themselves
into the conviction that what they wished
or imagined was actually true. Then they
all felt their consciences interested in the
investigation; and a select party, headed
by an old monk of influence and reputation,
waited on the Superior. They stated
to him my abstraction, my mechanical
movements, my automaton figure, my
meanless words, my stupified devotion,
my total alienation from the spirit of the
monastic life, while my scrupulous, <em>wooden</em>,
<em>jointless</em> exactness in its forms was
only a mockery. The Superior heard
them with great indifference. He had
held secret intelligence with my family,
had communicated with the Director, and
pledged himself that I should be a monk.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_259" title="259"> </a>
He had succeeded by dint of exertions,
(the result of which has been seen), and
now cared very little whether I was mad
or not. With a grave air he forbid their
further interference in the matter, and reserved
its future cognizance to himself.
They retired defeated, but not disappointed,
and they all pledged themselves to
each other to <em>watch me</em>; that is, to harass,
persecute, and torment me into being the
very character with which their malice,
their curiosity, or their mere industry of
idleness and wantonness of unoccupied invention,
had invested me already. From
that hour the whole convent was in a tumult
of conspiracy and combination.
Doors were clapped to wherever I was
heard to approach; and three or four
would stand whispering near where I
walked, and clear their throats, and exchange
signs, and pass <em>audibly</em> to the most
trifling topics in my hearing, as if to intimate,
while they affected to conceal it,
that their last topic had been <em>me</em>. I laughed
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_260" title="260"> </a>
at this internally. I said to myself,
“Poor perverted beings, with what affectation
of dramatic bustle and contrivance
you labour to diversify the misery of your
hopeless vacancy;&mdash;you struggle,&mdash;I submit.”
Soon the toils they were preparing
began to tighten round me. They would
throw themselves in my way with an assiduity
I could not avoid, and an appearance
of kindness I did not willingly repel.
They would say, in the blandest tones,
“My dear brother, you are melancholy,&mdash;you
are devoured with chagrin,&mdash;would
to God our fraternal efforts could banish
your regrets. But from what arises that
melancholy that appears to consume you?”
At these words I could not help fixing on
them eyes full of reproaches, and I believe
of tears,&mdash;but I did not utter a word.
The state in which they saw me, was a
sufficient cause for the melancholy with
which I was reproached. * *
* * * *</p>

<p>“This attack having failed, another method
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_261" title="261"> </a>
was tried. They attempted to make
me a party in the parties of the convent.
They told me a thousand things of unjust
partialities,&mdash;of unjust punishments, daily
to be witnessed in the convent. They talked
of a sickly brother being compelled to attend
matins, while the physician pronounced
his attendance on them must be his death,&mdash;<em>and
he died</em>,&mdash;while a young favourite,
in the bloom of health, had a dispensation
from matins whenever he pleased to lie till
nine in the morning;&mdash;of complaints that
the confessional was not attended to as it
ought,&mdash;and this might have made some
impression on me, till another complainant
added, and the <em>turning-box is not attended
to as it ought to be</em>. This union of
dissonant sounds,&mdash;this startling transition
from a complaint of neglecting the mysteries
of the soul in its profoundest communion
with God, to the lowest details of the
abuses of conventual discipline, revolted
me at once. I had with difficulty concealed
my disgust till then, and it was now so
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_262" title="262"> </a>
obvious, that the <em>party</em> gave up their attempt
for the moment, and beckoned to
an <em>experienced</em> monk to join me in my
solitary walk, as I broke from them. He
approached, “My brother, you are alone.”
“I wish to be so.” “But why?” “I am
not obliged to announce my reasons.”
“True, but you may confide them to me.”
“I have nothing to confide.” “I know
that,&mdash;I would not for the world intrude
on your confidence; reserve that for friends
more honoured.” It struck me as rather
odd, that he should, in the same breath,
ask for my confidence,&mdash;declare that he
was conscious I had nothing to intrust to
him,&mdash;and, lastly, request a reserve of my
confidence for some more favoured friend.
I was silent, however, till he said, “But,
my brother, you are devoured with ennui.”
I was silent still. “Would to God I could
find the means to dissipate it.” I said,
looking on him calmly, “Are those means
to be found within the walls of a convent?”
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_263" title="263"> </a>
“Yes, my dear brother,&mdash;yes, certainly,&mdash;the
debate in which the convent is now
engaged about the proper hour for matins,
which the Superior wants to have restored
to the original hour.” “What is the difference?”
“<em>Full five minutes.</em>” “I confess
the importance of the question.” “Oh!
if you once begin to feel it, there will be
no end of your happiness in a convent.
There is something every moment to inquire,
to be anxious about, and to contend
for. Interest yourself, my dear brother,
in these questions, and you will not
have a moment’s ennui to complain of.”
At these words I fixed my eyes on him.
I said calmly, but I believe emphatically,
“I have, then, only to excite in my own
mind, spleen, malignity, curiosity, every
passion that your retreat should have afforded
me protection against, to render that retreat
supportable. Pardon me, if I cannot,
like you, beg of God permission to take
his enemy into compact against the corruption
which I promote, while I presume to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_264" title="264"> </a>
pray against it.” He was silent, lifted up
his hands, and crossed himself; and I said
to myself, “God forgive your hypocrisy,”
as he went into another walk, and repeated
to his companions, “He is mad, irrecoverably
mad.” “But how, then?” said
several voices. There was a stifled whisper.
I saw several heads bent together. I
did not know what they were meditating,
nor did I care. I was walking alone,&mdash;it
was a delicious moon-light evening. I saw
the moon-beams through the trees, but the
trees all looked to me like walls. Their
trunks were as adamant, and the interlaced
branches seemed to twine themselves into
folds that said, “Beyond us there is no
passing.” I sat down by the side of a fountain,&mdash;there
was a tall poplar over it,&mdash;I
remember their situation well. An elderly
priest (who, I did not see, was detached
by the party) sat down beside me. He
began some common-place observations on
the transiency of human existence. I
shook my head, and he understood, by a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_265" title="265"> </a>
kind of tact not uncommon among Jesuits,
that <em>it would not do</em>. He shifted the subject,
remarked on the beauty of the foliage,
and the limpid purity of the fountain.
I assented. He added, “Oh that
life were pure as that stream!” I sighed,
“Oh that life were verdant and fertile to
me as that tree!” “But, my son, may not
fountains be dried up, and trees be withered?”
“Yes, my father,&mdash;yes,&mdash;the fountain
of my life has been dried up, and the
green branch of my life has been blasted
for ever.” As I uttered these words, I
could not suppress some tears. The father
seized on what he called the moment when
God was breathing on my soul. Our conversation
was very long, and I listened to
him with a kind of reluctant and stubborn
attention, because I had involuntarily been
compelled to observe, that he was the only
person in the whole community who had
never harassed me by the slightest importunity
either before my profession or after;
and when the worst things were said of me,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_266" title="266"> </a>
never seemed to attend; and when the
worst things were predicted of me, shook
his head and said nothing. His character
was unimpeached, and his religious
performances as exemplary and punctual
as my own. With all this I felt no
confidence in him, or in any human being;
but I listened to him with patience,
and my patience must have had no trivial
trial, for, at the end of an hour, (I did
not perceive that our conference was permitted
quite beyond the usual hour of
retirement), he continued repeating, “My
dear son, you will become reconciled to
the conventual life.” “My father, never,
never,&mdash;unless this fountain is dried up,
and this tree withered, by to-morrow.”
“My son, God has often performed greater
miracles for the salvation of a soul.”</p>

<p>“We parted, and I retired to my cell.
I know not how he and the others were
employed, but, before matins, there was
such a tumult in the convent, that one
would have thought Madrid was on fire.
Boarders, novices, and monks, ran about
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_267" title="267"> </a>
from cell to cell, up and down the stair-case,
through all the corridors, unrestrained
and unquestioned,&mdash;all order was at an
end. No bell was rung, no commands for
restoring tranquillity issued; the voice of
authority seemed to have made peace for
ever with the shouts of uproar. From my
window I saw them running through the
garden in every direction, embracing each
other, ejaculating, praying, and counting
their beads with hands tremulous, and eyes
uplifted in extacy. The hilarity of a convent
has something in it uncouth, unnatural,
and even alarming. I suspected
some mischief immediately, but I said to
myself, “The worst is over, they cannot
make me more than a monk.”&mdash;I was not
long left in doubt. Many steps approached
my cell, numerous voices were repeating,
“Hasten, dear brother, hasten to the
garden.” I was left no choice; they surrounded
and almost bore me to the garden.</p>

<p>“The whole community were assembled
there, the Superior among them not
attempting to suppress the confusion, but
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_268" title="268"> </a>
rather encouraging it. There was a suffusion
of joy in every countenance, and a
kind of artificial light in every eye, but
the whole performance struck me as hollow
and hypocritical. I was led, or rather
hurried to the spot where I had sat and
conversed so long the preceding evening.
<em>The fountain was dried up, and the tree
was withered.</em> I stood speechless with astonishment,
while every voice around me
repeated, “A miracle! a miracle!&mdash;God
himself has sealed your vocation with his
own hand.” The Superior made a signal
to them to stop. He said to me in a calm
voice, “My son, you are required only to
believe the evidence of your own eyes.
Will you make infidels of your very
senses, sooner than believe God? Prostrate
yourself, I adjure you, before him this moment,
and, by a public and solemn act of
faith, recognise that mercy that has not
scrupled a miracle to invite you to salvation.”
I was amazed more than touched
by what I saw and heard, but I threw myself
on my knees before them all, as I was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_269" title="269"> </a>
directed. I clasped my hands, and said
aloud, “My God, if you have indeed
vouchsafed this miracle on my account,
you will also doubtless enrich and illuminate
me with grace to apprehend and appreciate
it. My mind is dark, but you
can illuminate it. My heart is hard, but
it is not beyond the power of omnipotence
to touch and subdue it. An impression
made on it this moment, a whisper sent to
its recesses, is not less worthy of your
mercy than an impression on inanimate
matter, which only confounds my senses.”
The Superior interrupted me. He said,
“Hold, those are not the words you
should use. Your very faith is incredulous,
and your prayer an ironical insult on
the mercy it pretends to supplicate.” “My
father, put what words you please in my
mouth, and I will repeat them,&mdash;if I am
not convinced, I am at least subdued.”
“You must ask pardon of the community
for the offence your <em>tacit</em> repugnance to
the life of God has caused them.” I did
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_270" title="270"> </a>
so. “You must express your gratitude to
the community for the joy they have testified
at this miraculous evidence of the
truth of your vocation.” I did so. “You
must also express your gratitude to God,
for a visible interposition of supernatural
power, not more to the vindication of his
grace, than to the eternal honour of this
house, which he has been pleased to irradiate
and dignify by <em>a miracle</em>.” I hesitated
a little. I said, “My father, may I
be permitted to utter this prayer internally?”
The Superior hesitated too; he
thought it might not be well to push matters
too far, and he said at length, “As you
please.” I was still kneeling on the
ground, close to the tree and the fountain.
I now prostrated myself, with my face to
the earth, and prayed internally and intensely,
while they all stood around me;
but the language of my prayer was very
different from what they flattered themselves
I was uttering. On rising from my
knees, I was embraced by half the community.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_271" title="271"> </a>
Some of them actually shed
tears, the source of whose fountain was
surely not in their hearts. Hypocritical joy
insults only its dupe, but hypocritical grief
degrades the professor. That whole day
was passed in a kind of revelry. Exercises
were abridged,&mdash;the refections embellished
with confectionary,&mdash;every one had permission
to go from cell to cell, without an
order from the Superior. Presents of chocolate,
snuff, iced water, liqueurs, and (what
was more acceptable and necessary than
any of them) napkins and towels of the
finest and whitest damask, circulated among
all the members. The Superior was
shut up half the day with two <em>discreet</em>
brethren, as they are called, (that is, men
who are elected to take part with the Superior,
on supposition of their utter, superannuated
incapacity, as Pope Sixtus
was elected for his (supposed) imbecillity),
preparing an authenticated account of the
miracle, to be dispatched to the principal
convents in Spain. There was no need to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_272" title="272"> </a>
distribute the intelligence through Madrid,&mdash;they
were in possession of it an hour after
it happened,&mdash;the malicious say <em>an hour
before</em>.</p>

<p>“I must confess the agitating exhilaration
of this day, so unlike what I had
ever witnessed before in a convent, produced
an effect on me I cannot describe.
I was caressed,&mdash;made the hero of the <em>fete</em>,&mdash;(a
conventual fete has always something
odd and unnatural in it),&mdash;almost deified.
I gave myself up to the intoxication of
the day,&mdash;I did verily believe myself the
favourite of the Deity for some hours. I
said to myself a thousand flattering things.
If this deception was criminal, I expiated
my crime very soon. The next day every
thing was restored to its usual order, and
I found that the community could pass
from the extreme of disorder in a moment
to the rigidity of their usual habits.</p>

<p>“My conviction of this was certainly
not diminished within the few following
days. The oscillations of a convent vibrate
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_273" title="273"> </a>
within a very short interval. One
day all is relaxation, another all is inexorable
discipline. Some following days I received
a striking proof of that foundation
on which, in despite of a miracle, my repugnance
to a monastic life rested. Some
one, it was said, had committed a slight
breach of monastic duty. The <em>slight
breach</em> was <em>fortunately</em> committed by a
distant relation of the Archbishop of Toledo,
and consisted <em>merely in his entering
the church intoxicated</em>, (a rare
vice in Spaniards), attempting to drag
the matin preacher from the pulpit, and
failing in that, getting astride as well as
he could on the altar, dashing down the
tapers, overturning the vases and the pix,
and trying to scratch out, as with the talons
of a demon, the painting that hung
over the table, uttering all the while the
most horrible blasphemies, and even <em>soliciting
the portrait of the Virgin</em> in language
not to be repeated. A consultation
was held. The community, as may be
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_274" title="274"> </a>
guessed, was in an uproar while it lasted.
Every one but myself was anxious and
agitated. There was much talk of the inquisition,&mdash;the
scandal was so atrocious,&mdash;the
outrage so unpardonable,&mdash;and atonement
so impracticable. Three days
afterwards the archbishop’s mandate came
to stop all proceedings; and the following
day the youth who had committed
this sacrilegious outrage appeared
in the hall of the Jesuits, where the
Superior and a few monks were assembled,
read a short exercise which one of
them had written for him on the pithy
word “Ebrietas,” and departed to take
possession of a large benefice in the diocese
of the archbishop his relative. The
very next day after this scandalous scene
of compromise, imposture, and profanation,
a monk was detected in the act of
going, after the permitted hour, to an adjacent
cell to return a book he had borrowed.
As a punishment for this offence,
he was compelled to sit for three days at
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_275" title="275"> </a>
refection, while we were dining, barefooted
and his tunic reversed, on the stone
floor of the hall. He was compelled to
accuse himself aloud of every crime, and
of many not at all fit to be mentioned to
our ears, and exclaim at every interval,
“My God, my punishment is just.” On
the second day, it was found that a mat
had been placed under him by some merciful
hand. There was an immediate commotion
in the hall. The poor wretch was
labouring under a complaint that made it
worse than death to him to be compelled
to sit or rather lie on a stone floor; some
merciful being had surreptitiously conveyed
to him this mat. An investigation was
immediately commenced. A youth whom
I had not noticed before, started from the
table, and kneeling to the Superior, confessed
<em>his guilt</em>. The Superior assumed
a stern look, retired with some old monks
to consult on this new crime of humanity,
and in a few moments the bell was rung,
to give every one notice to retire to their
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_276" title="276"> </a>
cells. We all retired trembling, and while
we prostrated ourselves respectively before
the crucifix in our cells, wondered who
would be the next victim, or what might
be his punishment. I saw that youth but
once again. He was the son of a wealthy
and powerful family, but even his wealth
was no balance against his contumacy,
in the opinion of the convent, that is, of
four monks of rigid principles, whom the
Superior consulted that very evening.
The Jesuits are fond of courting power,
but they are still fonder of keeping it, if
they can, to themselves. The result of
their debate was, that the offender should
undergo a severe humiliation and penance
in their presence. His sentence was announced
to him, and he submitted to it.
He repeated every word of contrition they
dictated to him. He then bared his shoulders,
and applied the scourge till the blood
flowed, repeating between every stroke,
“My God, I ask pardon of thee for having
given the slightest comfort or relief to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_277" title="277"> </a>
Fra Paolo, during his merited penance.”
He performed all this, cherishing in the
bottom of his soul an intention still to
comfort and relieve Fra Paolo, whenever
he could find opportunity. He then
thought all was over. He was desired
to retire to his cell. He did so, but
the monks were not satisfied with this
examination. They had long suspected
Fra Paolo of irregularity, and imagined
they might extort the confession
of it from this youth, whose humanity
increased their suspicion. The virtues of
nature are always deemed vices in a convent.
Accordingly, he had hardly been in
bed when they surrounded him. They told
him they came by command of the Superior
to enjoin him a further penance, unless he
disclosed the secret of the interest he felt
for Fra Paolo. It was in vain he exclaimed,
“I have no interest but that of humanity
and compassion.” Those were words they
did not understand. It was in vain he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_278" title="278"> </a>
urged, “I will inflict whatever penance
the Superior is pleased to order, but my
shoulders are bleeding still,”&mdash;and he shewed
them. The executioners were pitiless.
They compelled him to quit his bed, and
applied the scourge with such outrageous
severity, that at last, mad with shame,
rage, and pain, he burst from them, and
ran through the corridor calling for assistance
or for mercy. The monks were in
their cells, none dared to stir,&mdash;they shuddered,
and turned on their straw pallets. It
was the vigil of Saint John the Lesser, and
I had been commanded what is called in
convents an hour of recollection, which
was to be passed in the church. I had
obeyed the order, and remained with my
face and body prostrate on the marble
steps of the altar, till I was almost unconscious,
when I heard the clock strike
twelve. I reflected the hour had elapsed
without a single recollection on my part.
“And thus it is to be always,” I exclaimed,
rising from my knees; “they deprive
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_279" title="279"> </a>
of the power of thinking, and then they
bid me recollect.” As I returned through
the corridor, I heard frightful cries&mdash;I
shuddered. Suddenly a phantom approached
me&mdash;I dropt on my knees&mdash;I
cried, “Satana vade retro&mdash;apage Satana.”
A naked human being, covered with
blood, and uttering screams of rage and
torture, flashed by me; four monks pursued
him&mdash;they had lights. I had shut
the door at the end of the gallery&mdash;I felt
they must return and pass me&mdash;I was still
on my knees, and trembling from head to
foot. The victim reached the door, found
it shut, and rallied. I turned, and saw a
groupe worthy of Murillo. A more perfect
human form never existed than that
of this unfortunate youth. He stood in
an attitude of despair&mdash;he was streaming
with <ins title="b ood">blood</ins>. The monks, with their lights,
their scourges, and their dark habits, seemed
like a groupe of demons who had made
prey of a wandering angel,&mdash;the groupe
resembled the infernal furies pursuing
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_280" title="280"> </a>
a mad Orestes. And, indeed, no ancient
sculptor ever designed a figure more
exquisite and perfect than that they had
so barbarously mangled. Debilitated as
my mind was by the long slumber of all
its powers, this spectacle of horror and
cruelty woke them in a moment. I rushed
forward in his defence&mdash;I struggled
with the monks&mdash;I uttered some expressions
which, though I hardly was conscious
of, they remembered and exaggerated
with all the accuracy of malice.</p>

<p>“I have no recollection of what followed;
but the issue of the business was, that I
was confined to my cell for the following
week, for my daring interference in the
discipline of the convent. And the additional
penance of the unfortunate novice,
for resisting that discipline, was inflicted
with such severity, that he became delirious
with shame and agony. He refused food,
he got no rest, and died the eighth night
after the scene I had witnessed. He was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_281" title="281"> </a>
of a temper unusually mild and amiable&mdash;he
had a taste for literature, and even the
disguise of a convent could not conceal the
distinguished graces of his person and manners.
Had he lived in the world, how
these qualities would have embellished it!
Perhaps the world would have abused
and perverted them&mdash;true; but would
the abuses of the world ever have brought
them to so frightful and disastrous a conclusion?&mdash;would
he have been first lashed
into madness, and then lashed out of existence?
He was interred in the church of
the convent, and the Superior himself pronounced
his eulogium&mdash;the Superior! by
whose order, or else permission, or at least
connivance, he had been driven mad, in
order to obtain a trivial and imaginary secret.</p>

<p>“During this exhibition, my disgust
arose to a degree incalculable. I had loathed
the conventual life&mdash;I now despised it;
and every judge of human nature knows,
that it is harder to eradicate the latter sentiment
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_282" title="282"> </a>
than the former. I was not long
without an occasion for the renewed exercise
of both feelings. The weather was
intensely hot that year&mdash;an epidemic complaint
broke out in the convent&mdash;every day
two or three were ordered to the infirmary,
and those who had merited slight penances
were allowed, by way of commutation,
to attend the sick. I was most
anxious to be of the number&mdash;I was even
resolved, by some slight deviation, to
tempt this punishment, which would have
been to me the highest gratification. Dare
I confess my motive to you, Sir? I was
anxious to see those men, if possible, divested
of the conventual disguise, and forced
to sincerity by the pangs of disease, and
the approach of death. I triumphed already
in the idea of their dying confession,
of hearing them acknowledge the seductions
employed to ensnare me, deplore the
miseries in which they had involved me,
and implore, with convulsed lips, my pardon
in&mdash;<em>no&mdash;not in vain</em>.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_283" title="283"> </a>“This wish, though vindictive, was not
without its palliations; but I was soon saved
the trouble of realizing it at my own
expence. That very evening the Superior
sent for me, and desired me to attend in
the infirmary, allowing me, at the same
time, remission from vespers. The first
bed I approached, I found Fra Paolo extended
on. He had never recovered the
effects of the complaint he laboured under
at the time of his penance; and the death
of the young novice so (fruitlessly incurred)
had been mortal to him.</p>

<p>“I offered him medicines&mdash;I attempted
to adjust him in his bed. He had been
greatly neglected. He repelled both offers,
and, feebly waving his hand, said, “Let
me, at least, die in peace.” A few moments
after, he unclosed his eyes, and recognized
me. A gleam of pleasure trembled
over his countenance, for he remembered
the interest I had shewn for his unfortunate
friend. He said, in a voice
hardly intelligible, “It is you, then?”
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_284" title="284"> </a>
“Yes, my brother, it is I&mdash;can I do any
thing for you?” After a long pause, he
added, “Yes, you can.” “Tell me then.”
He lowered his voice, which was before almost
inaudible, and whispered, “Let none
of them come near me in my dying moments&mdash;it
will not give you much trouble&mdash;those
moments are approaching.” I
pressed his hand in token of acquiescence.
But I felt there was something at once terrifying
and improper in this request from
a dying man. I said to him, “My dear
brother, you are then dying?&mdash;would you
not wish an interest in the prayers of the
community?&mdash;would you not wish the benefit
of the last sacraments?” He shook
his head, and I fear that I understood him
too well. I ceased any further importunity;
and a few moments he uttered, in
tones I could hardly distinguish, “<em>Let
them, let me die.</em>&mdash;They have left me no
power to form another wish.” His eyes
closed,&mdash;I sat beside his bed, holding his
hand in mine. At first, I could feel he attempted
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_285" title="285"> </a>
to press it&mdash;the attempt failed,
his hold relaxed. Fra Paolo was no more.</p>

<p>“I continued to sit holding the dead hand
in mine, till a groan from an adjacent bed
roused me. It was occupied by the old
monk with whom I had held a long conversation
the night before the miracle, in
which I still believed most firmly.</p>

<p>“I have observed, that this man was of a
temper and manners remarkably mild and
attractive. Perhaps this is always connected
with great weakness of intellect,
and coldness of character <em>in men</em>. (It may
be different in women&mdash;but my own experience
has never failed in the discovery,
that where there was a kind of feminine
softness and pliability in the male character,
there was also treachery, dissimulation,
and heartlessness.) At least, if there be
such an union, a conventual life is sure
to give it every advantage in its range
of internal debility, and external seductiveness.&mdash;That
pretence of a wish to assist,
without the power, or even the wish,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_286" title="286"> </a>
that is so flattering both to the weak minds
that exercise it, and the weaker on whom
it is exercised. This man had been always
judged very weak, and yet very fascinating.
He had been always employed
to ensnare the young novices. He was
now dying&mdash;overcome by his situation, I
forgot every thing but its tremendous
claims, and offered him every assistance in
my power. “I want nothing but to die,”
was his answer. His countenance was
perfectly calm, but its calmness was rather
that of apathy than of resignation.
“You are, then, perfectly sure of your approach
to blessedness?” “I know nothing
about it.” “How, my brother, are
those words for a dying man to utter?”
“Yes, if he speaks the truth.” “But a
monk?&mdash;a catholic?” “Those are but
names&mdash;I feel <em>that truth</em>, at least, now.”
“You amaze me!” “I care not&mdash;I am
on the verge of a precipice&mdash;I must plunge
from it&mdash;and whether the by-standers utter
outcries or not, is a matter of little consequence
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_287" title="287"> </a>
to me.” “And yet, you expressed
a willingness to die?” “Willingness!
Oh impatience!&mdash;I am a clock that has
struck the same minutes and hours for
sixty years. Is it not time for the machine
to long for its winding up? The
monotony of my existence would make a
transition, even to pain, desirable. I am
weary, and would change&mdash;that is all.”
“But to me, and to all the community,
you seemed to be resigned to the monastic
life.” “I seemed a lie&mdash;I lived a lie&mdash;I
was a lie&mdash;I ask pardon of my last moments
for speaking the truth&mdash;I presume
they neither can refuse me, or discredit my
words&mdash;I hated the monastic life. Inflict
pain on man, and his energies are roused&mdash;condemn
him to insanity, and he slumbers
like animals that have been found inclosed
in wood and stone, torpid and content;
but condemn him at once to pain and inanity,
as they do in convents, and you
unite the sufferings of hell and of annihilation.
For sixty years I have cursed my
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_288" title="288"> </a>
existence. I never woke to hope, for I
had nothing to do or to expect. I never
lay down with consolation, for I had, at
the close of every day, only to number so
many deliberate mockeries of God, as exercises
of devotion. The moment life is
put beyond the reach of your will, and
placed under the influence of mechanical
operations, it becomes, to thinking beings,
a torment insupportable.</p>

<p>“I never ate with appetite, because I
knew, that with or without it, I must go
to the refectory when the bell rung. I
never lay down to rest in peace, because I
knew the bell was to summon me in defiance
of nature, whether it was disposed
to prolong or shorten my repose. I never
prayed, for my prayers were dictated to
me. I never hoped, for my hopes were
founded not on the truth of God, but on
the promises and threatenings of man. My
salvation hovered on the breath of a being
as weak as myself, whose weakness I was
nevertheless obliged to flatter, and struggle
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_289" title="289"> </a>
to obtain a gleam of the grace of God,
through the dark distorted medium of the
vices of man. <em>It never reached me</em>&mdash;I
die without light, hope, faith, or consolation.”&mdash;He
uttered these words with a
calmness that was more terrific than the
wildest convulsions of despair. I gasped
for breath&mdash;“But, my brother, you were
always punctual in your religious exercises.”
“That was mechanism&mdash;will
you not believe a dying man?” “But
you urged me, in a long conversation, to
embrace the monastic life; and your importunity
must have been sincere, for it
was after my profession.” “It is natural
for the miserable to wish for companions
in their misery. This is very selfish, very
misanthropic, you will say, but it is also
very natural. You have yourself seen the
cages suspended in the cells&mdash;are not the
tame birds always employed to allure the
wild ones? We were caged birds, can
you blame us for the deception?” In these
words I could not help recognizing that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_290" title="290"> </a>
<em>simplicity of profound corruption</em><a name="FootnoteMarker_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="footnote-marker">(15)</a>,&mdash;that
frightful paralysis of the soul, which leaves
it incapable of receiving any impression
or making one,&mdash;that says to the accuser,
Approach, remonstrate, upbraid&mdash;I defy
you. My conscience is dead, and can neither
hear, utter, or echo a reproach. I was
amazed&mdash;I struggled against my own conviction.
I said, “But your regularity in
religious exercises&mdash;” “<em>Did you never
hear a bell toll?</em>” “But your voice was
always the loudest and most distinct in the
choir.” “<em>Did you never hear an organ
played?</em>” * * *
* * * *</p>

<p>I shuddered, yet I still went on with my
queries&mdash;I thought I could not know too
much. I said, “But, my brother, the religious
exercises in which you were constantly
engaged, must have imperceptibly
instilled something of their spirit into you?&mdash;is
it not so? You must have passed
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_291" title="291"> </a>
from the forms of religion into its spirit
ultimately?&mdash;is it not so, my brother?
Speak on the faith of a dying man. May
I have such a hope! I would undergo any
thing&mdash;any thing, to obtain it.” “There
is no such hope,” said the dying man, “deceive
not yourself with it. The repetition
of religious duties, without the feeling or
spirit of religion, produces an incurable
callosity of heart. There are not more irreligious
people to be found on earth than
those who are occupied always in its <em>externals</em>.
I verily believe half our lay-brothers
to be Atheists. I have heard and
read something of those whom we call heretics.
They have people to open their
pews, (shocking profanation you will call
it, to sell seats in the house of God, and
you are right), they have people to ring
bells when their dead are to be interred;
and these wretches have no other indication
of religion to give, but watching during
the whole time of service, (in which
their duties forbid them to partake), for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_292" title="292"> </a>
the fees which they extort, and dropping
upon their knees, ejaculating the names of
Christ and God, amid the rattling of the
pew-doors, which always operates on their
associations, and makes them bound from
their knees to gape for a hundredth part
of the silver for which Judas sold his Saviour
and himself. Then their bell-ringers&mdash;one
would imagine <em>death might humanize
them</em>. Oh! no such thing&mdash;they <em>extort
money in proportion to the depth of the
grave</em>. And the bell-ringer, the sexton,
and the survivors, fight sometimes a manual
battle over the senseless remains, whose
torpidity is the most potent and silent reproach
to this unnatural conflict.” I knew
nothing of this, but I grasped at his former
words, “You die, then, without hope or
confidence?” He was silent. “Yet you
urged me by eloquence almost divine, by
a miracle verified before my own eyes.”
He laughed. There is something very
horrible in the laugh of a dying man:
Hovering on the verge of both worlds, he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_293" title="293"> </a>
seems to give the lie to both, and proclaim
the enjoyments of one, and the hopes of
another, alike an imposture. “I performed
that miracle myself,” he said with all
the calmness, and, alas! something of the
triumph of a deliberate impostor. “I
knew the reservoir by which the fountain
was supplied&mdash;by consent of the Superior
it was drawn off in the course of the night.
We worked hard at it, and laughed at your
credulity every pump we drew.” “But
the tree&mdash;” “I was in possession of some
chemical secrets&mdash;I have not time to disclose
them now&mdash;I scattered a certain fluid over
the leaves of the poplar that night, and
they <em>appeared</em> withered by the morning&mdash;go
look at them a fortnight hence, and
you will see them as green as ever.” “And
these are your dying words?” “They are.”
“And why did you deceive me thus?”
He struggled a short time at this question,
and then rising almost upright in his bed,
exclaimed, “Because I was a monk, and
wished for victims of my imposture to gratify
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_294" title="294"> </a>
my pride! and companions of my misery,
to soothe its malignity!” He was
convulsed as he spoke, the natural mildness
and calmness of his physiognomy
were changed for something that I cannot
describe&mdash;something at once derisive, triumphant,
and diabolical. I forgave him
every thing in that horrible moment. I
snatched a crucifix that lay by his bed&mdash;I
offered it to his lips. He pushed it away.
“If I wanted to have this farce acted, I
should choose another actor. You know
I might have the Superior and half the
convent at my bed-side this moment if I
pleased, with their tapers, their holy water,
and their preparations for extreme unction,
and all the masquerade of death, by which
they try to dupe even the dying, and insult
God even on the threshold of his own
eternal mansion. I suffered you to sit beside
me, because I thought, from your repugnance
to the monastic life, you might
be a willing hearer of its deceptions, and
its despair.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_295" title="295"> </a>“Deplorable as had been the image of
that life to me before, this representation
exceeded my imagination. I had viewed
it as excluding all the enjoyments of life,
and thought the prospect blasting; but
now the other world was weighed in the
balance, and found wanting. The genius
of monasticism seemed to wield a two-edged
sword, and to lift it between and
against time and eternity. The blade bore
a two-fold inscription&mdash;on the side next
the world was written the word “suffer,”&mdash;on
that opposed to eternity, “despair.”
In the utter hopelessness of my soul, I still
continued to question <em>him</em> for hope&mdash;him!
while he was bereaving me of its very shadow,
by every word he uttered. “But,
must all be plunged in this abyss of darkness?
Is there no light, no hope, no refuge,
for the sufferer? May not some of
us become reconciled to our situation&mdash;first
patient of it, then attached to it? Finally,
may we not (if our repugnance be invincible)
make a merit of it with God, and offer
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_296" title="296"> </a>
to him the sacrifice of our earthly hopes
and wishes, in the confidence of an ample
and glorious equivalent? Even if we are
unable to offer this sacrifice with the unction
which would ensure its acceptance,
still may we not hope it will not be wholly
neglected?&mdash;that we may become tranquil,
if not happy&mdash;resigned, if not content.
Speak, tell me if this may be?”
“And you wish to extort deception from
the lips of death&mdash;but you will fail.
Hear your doom&mdash;Those who are possessed
of what may be called the religious
character, that is, those who are
visionary, weak, morose, and ascetic, may
elevate themselves to a species of intoxication
in the moments of devotion.
They may, while clasping the images,
work themselves into the delusion, that
the dead stone thrills to their touch; that
the figures move, assent to their petitions,
and turn their lifeless eyes on them with
an expression of benignity. They may,
while kissing the crucifix, believe that they
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_297" title="297"> </a>
hear celestial voices pronouncing their pardon;
that the Saviour of the world extends
his arms to them, to invite them to beatitude;
that all heaven is expanded to their
view, and the harmonies of paradise are
enriched to glorify their apotheosis. But
this is a mere inebriation that the most ignorant
physician could produce in his patients
by certain medicines. The secret
of this ecstatic swoon might be traced to
an apothecary’s shop, or purchased at a
cheaper rate. The inhabitants of the north
of Europe procure this state of exaltation
by the use of liquid fire&mdash;the Turks by
opium&mdash;the Dervises by dancing&mdash;and
Christian monks by spiritual pride operating
on the exhaustion of a macerated
frame. It is all intoxication, with this
difference only, that the intoxication of
men of this world produces always <em>self</em>-complacency&mdash;that
of men of the other
world, a complacency whose supposed
source is derived from God. The intoxication
is, therefore, more profound, more
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_298" title="298"> </a>
delusive, and more dangerous. But nature,
violated by these excesses, exacts a
most usurious interest for this illicit indulgence.
She makes them pay for moments
of rapture with hours of despair. Their
precipitation from extasy to horror is almost
instantaneous. In the course of a
few moments, they pass from being the favourites
of Heaven to becoming its outcasts.
They doubt the truth of their
raptures,&mdash;the truth of their vocation.
They doubt every thing&mdash;the sincerity
of their prayers, even the efficacy of the
Saviour’s atonement, and the intercession
of the blessed Virgin. They plunge
from paradise to hell. They howl, they
scream, they blaspheme. From the bottom
of the infernal gulph in which they
imagine themselves plunged, they bellow
imprecations against their Creator&mdash;they
denounce themselves as damned from all
eternity for their sins, while their only sin
is their inability to support preternatural
excitement. The paroxysm <ins title="ceases">ceases,</ins> they
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_299" title="299"> </a>
become the elect of God again in their own
imaginations. And to those who interrogate
them with regard to their late despair,
they answer, That Satan was permitted to
buffet them&mdash;that they were under the
hidings of God’s face, &amp;c. All saints, from
Mahomet down to Francis Xavier, were
only a compound of insanity, pride, and
self-imposition;&mdash;the latter would have
been of less consequence, but that men
always revenge their imposition on themselves,
by imposing to the utmost on
others.”</p>

<p>“There is no more horrible state of
mind than that in which we are <em>forced by
conviction to listen on, wishing every
word to be false, and knowing every word
to be true</em>. Such was mine, but I tried
to palliate it by saying, “It was never my
ambition to be a saint; but is the lot of all,
then, so deplorable?” The monk, who
appeared to rejoice in this opportunity to
discharge the concentrated malignity of
sixty years of suffering and hypocrisy,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_300" title="300"> </a>
collected his dying voice to answer. He
seemed as if he never could inflict enough,
for what had been inflicted on himself.
“Those who possess strong sensibility,
without the religious character, are of all
others the most unhappy, but their miseries
are soonest terminated. They are
harassed by trivial constraints, stupified
by monotonous devotion, exasperated by
dull insolence and bloated superiority.
They struggle, they resist. Penance and
punishment are applied. Their own violence
justifies increased violence of treatment;
and, at all events, it would be applied
without this justification, for there is
nothing that delights the pride of power,
more than a victorious strife with the pride
of intellect. The remainder is easily to
be conceived by you, who have witnessed
it. You saw the unfortunate youth who
interfered about Paolo. He was lashed
to madness. Tortured first to phrenzy,
then to stupefaction,&mdash;he died! I was the
secret, unsuspected adviser of the whole
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_301" title="301"> </a>
proceeding.” “Monster!” I exclaimed,
for truth had made us equal <em>now</em>, and even
precluded the language that humanity
would dictate when uttered to a dying
man.&mdash;“But why?”&mdash;said he, with that
calmness which had once attracted, and
now revolted me, but which had at all
times undisputed possession of his physiognomy;&mdash;“his
sufferings were shorter,
do you blame me for diminishing their duration?”&mdash;There
was something cold, ironical,
and jeering, even in the suavity of
this man, that gave a certain force to his
simplest observations. It seemed as if he
had reserved the truth all his life, to utter
it at his dying hour. “Such is the fate of
those who possess strong sensibility; those
who have less languish away in an imperceptible
decline. They spend their time
in watching a few flowers, in tending
birds. They are punctual in their religious
exercises, they receive neither blame
or praise,&mdash;they melt away in torpor and
ennui. They wish for death, as the preparation
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_302" title="302"> </a>
it might put the convent to might
produce a short excitement, but they are
disappointed, for their state forbids excitement,
and they die as they have lived,&mdash;unexcited,
unawakened. The tapers are
lit, they do not see them,&mdash;the unction is
applied, they do not feel it,&mdash;prayers are
uttered, they cannot partake in them;&mdash;in
fact, the whole drama is acted, but the
principal performer is absent,&mdash;is gone.
Others indulge themselves in perpetual reverie.
They walk alone in the cloister,&mdash;in
the garden. They feed themselves with
the poison of delicious, innutritive illusion.
They dream that an earthquake
will shake the walls to atoms, that a volcano
will burst forth in the centre of the
garden. They imagine a revolution of
government,&mdash;an attack of banditti,&mdash;any
thing, however improbable. Then they
take refuge in the possibility of a fire, (if
a fire bursts out in a convent, the doors
are thrown open, and “Sauve qui peut,”
is the word). At this thought they conceive
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_303" title="303"> </a>
the most ardent hope,&mdash;they could
rush out,&mdash;they could precipitate themselves
into the streets, into the country,&mdash;in
fact, they would fly any where
to escape. Then these hopes fail,&mdash;they
begin to get nervous, morbid, restless.
If they have interest, they are indulged
with remission from their duties, and
they remain in their cells, relaxed,&mdash;torpid,&mdash;idiotical;
if they have not interest,
they are forced to the punctual performance
of their duties, and then idiotism
comes on much sooner, as diseased horses,
employed in a mill, become blind sooner
than those who are suffered to wear out
existence in ordinary labour. Some of
them take refuge in religion, as they call
it. They call for relief on the Superior,
but what can the Superior do? He is but
human too, and perhaps feels the despair
that is devouring the wretches who supplicate
him to deliver them from it. Then
they prostrate themselves before the images
of the saints,&mdash;they invoke, they sometimes
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_304" title="304"> </a>
revile them. They call for their intercession,
deplore its inefficacy, and fly to
some other, whose merits they imagine
are higher in the sight of God. They
supplicate for an interest in the intercession
of Christ and the Virgin, as their last
resort. That resort fails them too,&mdash;the
Virgin herself is inexorable, though they
wear out her pedestal with their knees,
and her feet with their kisses. Then they
go about the galleries at night, they rouse
the sleepers, they knock at every door,&mdash;they
cry, “Brother Saint Jerome, pray for
me,&mdash;Brother Saint Augustine, pray for
me.” Then the placard is seen fastened to
the rails of the altar, “Dear brothers, pray
for the wandering soul of a monk.” The
next day the placard bears this inscription,
“The prayers of the community are implored
for a monk who is in despair.”
Then they find human intercession as unavailing
as divine, to procure them a remission
of the sufferings which, while
<em>their profession</em> continues to inflict on
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_305" title="305"> </a>
them, no power can reverse or mitigate.
They crawl to their cells,&mdash;in a few days
the toll of the bell is heard, and the
brethren exclaim, “He died in the odour of
sanctity,” and hasten to spread their snares
for another victim.” “And is this, then,
monastic life?” “It is,&mdash;there are but two
exceptions, that of those who can every day
renew, by the aid of imagination, the hope
of escape, and who cherish that hope even
on their dying bed; and those who, like
me, diminish their misery by dividing it,
and, like the spider, feel relieved of the
poison that swells, and would burst them,
by instilling a drop of it into every insect
that toils, agonizes, and perishes in their
net,&mdash;<em>like you</em>.” At these last words, a
glare of malignity flashed on the features
of the dying wretch, that appalled me. I
retreated from his bed for a moment. I
returned, I looked at him,&mdash;his eyes were
closed,&mdash;his hands extended. I touched
him,&mdash;raised him,&mdash;he was dead,&mdash;those
were his last words. The expression of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_306" title="306"> </a>
his features was the physiognomy of his
soul,&mdash;they were calm and pale, but still a
cold expression of derision lingered about
the curve of his lips.</p>

<p>“I rushed from the infirmary. I was
at that time indulged, like all the other
visitants of the sick, to go to the garden
beyond the allotted hours, perhaps to diminish
the chance of infection. I was but
too ready to avail myself of this permission.
The garden, with its calm moon-light
beauty, its innocence of heaven, its
theology of the stars, was at once a reproach
and a consolation to me. I tried
to reflect, to feel,&mdash;both efforts failed; and
perhaps it is in this silence of the soul, this
suspension of all the clamorous voices of the
passions, that we are most ready to hear
the voice of God. My imagination suddenly
represented to me the august and ample
vault above me as a church,&mdash;the images of
the saints grew dim in my eyes as I gazed
on the stars, and even the altar, over which
the crucifixion of the Saviour of the world
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_307" title="307"> </a>
was represented, turned pale to the eye
of the soul, as I gazed on the moon
“walking in her brightness.” I fell on
my knees. I knew not to whom I was
about to pray, but I never felt so disposed
to pray. I felt my habit touched at
this moment. I at first trembled, from
the idea of being detected in a forbidden
act. I started up. A dark figure stood
beside me, who said in indistinct and
faultering tones, “Read this,” and he
thrust a paper into my hand; “I have
worn it sewed into my habit for four days.
I have watched you night and day. I had
no opportunity but this,&mdash;you were in
your cell, in the choir, or in the infirmary.
Tear it in pieces, throw the fragments into
the fountain, or <em>swallow them</em>, the
moment you have read it.&mdash;Adieu. I
have risked every thing for you,” and he
glided away. I recognized his figure as
he departed; it was the porter of the convent.
I well understood the risk he must
have run in delivering this paper, for it
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_308" title="308"> </a>
was the regulation of the convent, that all
letters, whether addressed to or written by
boarders, novices, or monks, were first to
be read by the Superior, and I never knew
an instance of its infringement. The
moon gave me sufficient light. I began
to read, while a vague hope, that had
neither object or basis, trembled at the
bottom of my heart. The paper contained
these words:</p>

<p>“My dearest brother, (my God! how I
started!) I see you revolt at the first lines
which I address to you,&mdash;I implore you,
for both our sakes, to read them with calmness
and attention. We have been both
the victims of parental and priestly imposition;
the former we must forgive, for
our parents are the victims of it too. The
Director has their consciences in his hand,
and their destiny and ours at his feet.
Oh, my brother, what a tale have I to
disclose to you! I was brought up, by the
Director’s orders, whose influence over the
domestics is as unbounded as it is over
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_309" title="309"> </a>
their unhappy master, in complete hostility
against you, as one who was depriving
me of my natural rights, and degrading
the family by your illegitimate intrusion.
May not this palliate, in some degree, my
unnatural repulsiveness when we first met?
I was taught from my cradle to hate and
fear you,&mdash;to hate you as an enemy, and
fear you as an impostor. This was the
Director’s plan. He thought the hold he
had over my father and mother too slight
to gratify his ambition of domestic power,
or realize his hopes of professional distinction.
The basis of all ecclesiastical power
rests upon fear. A crime must be discovered
or invented. The vague reports
circulated in the family, my mother’s constant
dejection, my father’s occasional agitation,
offered him a clue, which he followed
with incessant industry through all
its windings of doubt, mystery, and disappointment,
till, in a moment of penitence,
my mother, terrified by his constant
denunciations if she concealed any secret
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_310" title="310"> </a>
of her heart or life from him, disclosed the
truth.</p>

<p>“We were both infants then. He adopted
immediately the plan he has since
realized at the expence of all but himself.
I am convinced he had not, from the first
hour of his machinations, the least malignity
against you. The aggrandizement of
his interest, which ecclesiastics always individualize
with that of the church, was
his only object. To dictate, to tyrannize,
to manage a whole family, and that of
rank, by his knowledge of the frailty of
one of its members, was all he looked to.
Those who by their vows are excluded
from the interest which natural affections
give us in life, must seek for it in the artificial
ones of pride and domination, and
the Director found it there. All thenceforth
was conducted and inspired by him.
It was he who caused us to be kept asunder
from our infancy, fearful that nature
might frustrate his plans,&mdash;it was he who
reared me in sentiments of implacable animosity
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_311" title="311"> </a>
against you. When my mother
fluctuated, he reminded her of her vow,
with which she had rashly intrusted him.
When my father murmured, the shame of
my mother’s frailty, the bitter feuds of
domestic discussion, the tremendous sounds
of imposture, perjury, sacrilege, and the
resentment of the church, were thundered
in his ears. You may conceive there is
nothing this man would shrink at, when,
almost in my childhood, he disclosed to
me my mother’s frailty, to insure my
early and zealous participation in his
views. Heaven blast the wretch who
could thus contaminate the ears, and
wither the heart of a child, with the tale
of a parent’s shame, to secure a partizan
for the church! This was not all. From
the first hour I was able to hear and comprehend
him, he poisoned my heart by
every channel he could approach. He
exaggerated my mother’s partiality for
you, which he assured me often contended
vainly with her conscience. He
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_312" title="312"> </a>
represented my father as weak and dissipated,
but affectionate; and, with the natural
pride of a boy-father, immoveably
attached to his eldest offspring. He said,
“My son, prepare yourself to struggle
with a host of prejudices,&mdash;the interests
of God, as well as of society, demand it.
<em>Assume a high tone with your parents</em>,&mdash;you
are in possession of the secret that
corrodes their consciences, make your own
use of it.” Judge the effect of these words
on a temper naturally violent,&mdash;words, too,
uttered by one whom I was taught to regard
as the agent of the Divinity.</p>

<p>“All this time, as I have since been informed,
he was debating in his own mind
whether he would not adopt your part instead
of mine, or at least vacillate between
both, so as to augment his influence
over our parents, by the additional feature
of suspicion. Whatever influenced
his determination, the effect of his lessons
on me may be easily calculated. I became
restless, jealous, and vindictive;&mdash;insolent
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_313" title="313"> </a>
to my parents, and suspicious of all around
me. Before I was eleven years of age I
reviled my father for his partiality to you,&mdash;I
insulted my mother with her crime,&mdash;I
tyrannized over the domestics,&mdash;I was
the dread and the torment of the whole
household; and the wretch who had made
me thus a premature demon, had outraged
nature, and compelled me to trample
on every tie he should have taught me to
hallow and cherish, consoled himself with
the thought that he was obeying the calls
of his function, and strengthening the
hands of the church.</p>

<p>“On the day preceding our first meeting,
(which had not been intended before),
the Director went to my father; he said,
“Senhor, I think it best the brothers
should meet. Perhaps God may touch
their hearts, and by his merciful influence
over them, enable you to reverse the decree
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_314" title="314"> </a>
that threatens one of them with seclusion,
and both with a cruel and final
separation.” My father assented with
tears of delight. Those tears did not melt
the heart of the Director; he hastened to
my apartment, and said, “My child, summon
all your resolution, your artful, cruel,
partial parents, are <em>preparing a scene</em> for
you,&mdash;they are determined on introducing
you to your spurious brother.” “I will
spurn him before their faces, if they dare
to do so,” said I, with the pride of premature
tyranny. “No, my child, that will
not do, you must appear to comply with
their wishes, but you must not be their
victim,&mdash;promise me that, my dear child,&mdash;promise
me resolution and dissimulation.”
“I promise you resolution, keep
the dissimulation for yourself.” “Well, I
will do so, since your interests require it.”
He hurried back to my father. “Senhor,
I have employed all the eloquence of heaven
and nature with your younger son.
He is softened,&mdash;he melts already,&mdash;he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_315" title="315"> </a>
longs to precipitate himself into the fraternal
embrace, and hear your benediction
poured over the united hearts and bodies
of your two children,&mdash;they are both your
children. You must banish all prejudices,
and<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>” “I have no prejudices!” said
my poor father; “let me but see my children
embrace, and if Heaven summoned
me at that moment, I should obey it
by dying of joy.”&mdash;The Director reproved
him for the expressions which gushed from
his heart, and, wholly unmoved by them,
hurried back to me, full of his commission.
“My child, I have warned you of the
conspiracy formed against you by your
own family. You will receive a proof of
it to-morrow,&mdash;your brother is to be introduced,&mdash;you
will be required to embrace
him,&mdash;your consent is reckoned on, but at
the moment you do so, your father is resolved
to interpret this as the signal, on
your part, of the resignation of all your
natural rights. Comply with your hypocritical
parents, embrace this brother, but
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_316" title="316"> </a>
give an air of repugnance to the action
that will justify your conscience, while it
deceives those who would deceive you.
Watch the signal-word, my dear child;
embrace him as you would a serpent,&mdash;his
art is not less, and his poison as deadly.
Remember that your resolution will decide
the event of this meeting. Assume
the appearance of affection, but remember
you hold your deadliest enemy in your
arms.” At these words, unnatural as I
was, I shuddered. I said, “My brother!”
“Never mind,” said the Director, “he is
the enemy of God,&mdash;an illegitimate impostor.
Now, my child, are you prepared?”
and I answered, “I am prepared.”
That night, however, I was very restless.
I required the Director to be summoned.
I said in my pride, “But how is this poor
wretch (meaning you) to be disposed of?”
“Let him embrace the monastic life,” said
the Director. At these words I felt an
interest on your account I had never recognized
before. I said decidedly, for he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_317" title="317"> </a>
had taught me to assume a tone of decision,
“He shall never be a monk.” The
Director appeared staggered, yet he trembled
before the spirit he had himself raised.
“Let him go into the army,” I said;
“let him inlist as a common soldier, I can
supply him with the means of promotion;&mdash;let
him engage in the meanest profession,
I shall not blush to acknowledge
him, but, father, he shall never be a
monk.” “But, my dear child, on what
foundation does this extraordinary objection
rest? It is the only means to restore
peace to the family, and procure it for the
unfortunate being for whom you are so
much interested.” “My father, have
done with this language. Promise me,
as the condition of my obedience to your
wishes to-morrow, that my brother shall
never be compelled to be a monk.” “Compelled,
my dear child! there can be no
compulsion in a holy vocation.” “I am
not certain of that; but I demand from
you the promise I have mentioned.” The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_318" title="318"> </a>
Director hesitated, at last he said, “I promise.”
And he hastened to tell my father
there was no longer any opposition to our
meeting, and that I was delighted with
the determination which had been announced
to me of my brother eagerly embracing
the monastic life. Thus was our
first meeting arranged. When, at the
command of my father, our arms were entwined,
I swear to you, my brother, I felt
them thrill with affection. But the instinct
of nature was soon superseded by
the force of habit, and I recoiled, collected
all the forces of nature and passion in
the terrible expression that I dared to direct
towards our parents, while the Director
stood behind them smiling, and encouraging
me by gestures. I thought I
had acted my part with applause, at least
I gave myself enough, and retired from
the scene with as proud a step as if I had
trampled on a prostrate world,&mdash;I had only
trampled on nature and my own heart.
A few days after I was sent to a convent.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_319" title="319"> </a>
The Director was alarmed at the dogmatizing
tone he himself had taught me to
assume, and he urged the necessity of my
education being attended to. My parents
complied with every thing he required.
I, for a wonder, consented; but, as the
carriage conveyed me to the convent, I
repeated to the Director, “Remember,
my brother is not to be a monk.”</p>

<p>“(After these lines several were unintelligible
to me, apparently from the agitation
under which they were written;&mdash;the precipitancy
and fiery ardor of my brother’s
character communicated itself to his writings.
After many a defaced page I could
trace the following words.) * *
* * * *</p>

<p>“It was singular enough that you, who
were the object of my inveterate hatred
before my residence in the convent, became
the object of my interest from that
moment. I had adopted your cause from
pride, I now upheld it from experience.
Compassion, instinct, whatever it was, began
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_320" title="320"> </a>
to assume the character of a duty.
When I saw the indignity with which the
lower classes were treated, I said to myself,
“No, he shall never suffer that,&mdash;he
is my brother.” When I succeeded in my
exercises, and was applauded, I said, “This
is applause in which he never can share.”
When I was punished, and that was much
more frequently, I said, “He shall never
feel this mortification.” My imagination
expanded. I believed myself your future
patron, I conceived myself redeeming the
injustice of nature, aiding and aggrandizing
you, forcing you to confess that you
owed more to me than to your parents,
and throwing myself, with a disarmed and
naked heart, on your gratitude alone for
affection. I heard you call me brother,&mdash;I
bid you stop, and call me benefactor.
My nature, proud, generous, and fiery,
had not yet quite emancipated itself from
the influence of the Director, but every
effort it made pointed, by an indescribable
impulse, towards you. Perhaps the secret
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_321" title="321"> </a>
of this is to be found in the elements of
my character, which always struggled against
dictation, and loved to teach itself
all it wished to know, and inspire itself
with the object of its own attachments.
It is certain that I wished for your friendship,
at the moment I was instructed to
hate you. Your mild eyes and affectionate
looks haunted me perpetually in
the convent. To the professions of friendship
repeatedly made me by the boarders,
I answered, “I want a brother.” My conduct
was eccentric and violent,&mdash;no wonder,
for my conscience had begun to operate
against my habits. Sometimes I
would apply with an eagerness that made
them tremble for my health; at others, no
punishment, however severe, could make
me submit to the ordinary discipline of the
house. The community grew weary of
my obstinacy, violence, and irregularities.
They wrote to the Director to have me
removed, but before this could be accomplished
I was seized with a fever. They
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_322" title="322"> </a>
paid me unremitting attention, but there
was something on my mind no cares of
theirs could remove. When they brought
me medicine with the most scrupulous
punctuality, I said, “Let my brother
fetch it, and if it be poison I will drink it
from his hand; I have injured him much.”
When the bell tolled for matins and vespers,
I said, “Are they going to make
my brother a monk? The Director promised
me differently, but you are all deceivers.”
At length they muffled the
bell. I heard its stifled sound, and I
exclaimed, “You are tolling for his funeral,
but I,&mdash;I am his murderer!” The
community became terrified at these exclamations
so often repeated, and with the
meaning of which they could not accuse
themselves. I was removed in a state of
delirium to my father’s palace in Madrid.
A figure like yours sat beside me in the
carriage, alighted when we stopped, accompanied
me where I remained, assisted me
when I was placed again in the carriage.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_323" title="323"> </a>
So vivid was the impression, that I was
accustomed to say to the attendants, “Stop,
my brother is assisting me.” When they
asked me in the morning how I had rested?
I answered, “Very well,&mdash;Alonzo has
been all night at my bed-side.” I invited
this visionary companion to continue
his attentions; and when the pillows
were arranged to my satisfaction,
I would say, “How kind my brother is,&mdash;how
useful,&mdash;but <em>why will he not
speak</em>?” At one stage I absolutely refused
nourishment, because the phantom
appeared to decline it. I said, “Do not
urge me, my brother, you see, will not accept
of it. Oh, I entreat his pardon, it is
a day of abstinence,&mdash;that is his reason,
you see how he points to his habit,&mdash;that
is enough.” It is very singular that the
food at this house happened to be poisoned,
and that two of my attendants died
of partaking of it before they could reach
Madrid. I mention these circumstances,
merely to prove the rivetted hold you had
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_324" title="324"> </a>
taken both of my imagination and my affections.
On the recovery of my intellect,
my first inquiry was for you. This
had been foreseen, and my father and mother,
shunning the discussion, and even
trembling for the event, as they knew the
violence of my temper, intrusted the whole
business to the Director. He undertook
it,&mdash;how he executed it is yet to be seen.
On our first meeting he approached me
with congratulations on my convalescence,
with regrets for the constraints I must
have suffered in the convent, with assurances
that my parents would make my
home a paradise. When he had gone on
for some time, I said, “What have you
done with my brother?” “He is in the
bosom of God,” said the Director, crossing
himself. I understood him in a moment,&mdash;I
rushed past him before he had finished.
“Where are you going, my son?” “To
my parents.” “Your parents,&mdash;it is impossible
that you can see them now.”
“But it is certain that I will see them.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_325" title="325"> </a>
Dictate to me no longer,&mdash;degrade yourself
not by this prostituted humiliation,”
for he was putting himself in a posture of
intreaty,&mdash;“I <em>will</em> see my parents. Procure
for me an introduction to them this
moment, or tremble for the continuance
of your influence in the family.” At these
words he trembled. He did not indeed
dread my influence, but he dreaded my
passions. His own lessons were bitterly
retaliated on him that moment. He had
made me fierce and impetuous, because
that suited his purpose, but he had neither
calculated on, or prepared himself for, this
extraordinary direction which my feelings
had taken, so opposite to that which he had
laboured to give them. He thought, in
exciting my passions, he could ascertain
their direction. Woe be to those, who,
in teaching the elephant to direct his
trunk against their foes, forget that by a
sudden convolution of that trunk, he may
rend the driver from his back, and trample
him under his feet into the mire. Such
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_326" title="326"> </a>
was the Director’s situation and mine, I
insisted on going instantly to my father’s
presence. He interposed, he supplicated;
at last, as a hopeless resource, he reminded
me of his continual indulgence, his flattery
of my passions. My answer was
brief, but Oh that it might sink into the
souls of such tutors and such priests!
“And that has made me what I am.
Lead the way to my father’s apartment, or
I will spurn you before me to the door of
it.” At this threat, which he saw I was
able to execute, (for you know my frame
is athletic, and my stature twice that of
his), he trembled; and I confess this indication
of both physical and mental debility
completed my contempt for him. He
crawled before me to the apartment where
my father and mother were seated, in a
balcony that overlooked the garden. They
had imagined all was settled, and were astonished
to see me rush in, followed by the
Director, with an aspect that left them
no reason to hope for an auspicious result
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_327" title="327"> </a>
of our conference. The Director gave
them a sign which I did not observe, and
which they had not time to profit by,&mdash;and
as I stood before them livid from my
fever, on fire with passion, and trembling
with inarticulate expressions, they shuddered.
Some looks of reproach were levelled
by them at the Director, which he returned,
as usual, by signs. I did not understand
<em>them</em>, but I made them understand me in
a moment. I said to my father, “Senhor,
is it true you have made my brother a
monk?” My father hesitated; at last he
said, “I thought the Director had been
commissioned to speak to you on that subject.”
“Father, what has a Director to
do in the concerns of a parent and child?
That man never can be a parent,&mdash;never
can have a child, how then can he be a
judge in a case like this?” “You forget
yourself,&mdash;you forget the respect due to a
minister of the church.” “My father, I
am but just raised from a death-bed, my
mother and you trembled for my life,&mdash;that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_328" title="328"> </a>
life still depends on your words. I
promised submission to this wretch, on a
condition which he has violated, which&mdash;”
“Command yourself, Sir,” said my father,
in a tone of authority which ill suited the
trembling lips it issued from, “or quit the
apartment.” “Senhor,” interposed the
Director, in a softened tone, “let not me
be the cause of dissension in a family
whose happiness and honour have been always
my object, next to the interests of
the church. Let him go on, the remembrance
of my crucified Master will sustain
me under his insults,” and he crossed himself.
“Wretch!” I cried, grasping his
habit, “you are a hypocrite, a deceiver!”
and I know not of what violence I might
have been guilty, but my father interposed.
My mother shrieked with terror,
and a scene of confusion followed, in
which I recollect nothing but the hypocritical
exclamations of the Director, appearing
to struggle between my father
and me, while he mediated with God for
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_329" title="329"> </a>
both. He repeated incessantly, “Senhor,
do not interpose, every indignity I suffer
I make a sacrifice to Heaven; it will qualify
me to be an intercessor for my traducer
with God;” and, crossing himself,
he called on the most sacred names, and
exclaimed, “Let insults, calumnies, and
blows, be added to that preponderance of
merit which is already weighed in the
scales of heaven against my offences,” and
he dared to mix the claims of the intercession
of the saints, the purity of the immaculate
Virgin, and even the blood and
agony of Jesus Christ, with the vile submissions
of his own hypocrisy. The room
was by this time filled with attendants.
My mother was conveyed away, still
shrieking with terror. My father, who
loved her, was driven by this spectacle,
and by my outrageous conduct, to a pitch
of fury,&mdash;he drew his sword. I burst into
a laugh, that froze his blood as he approached
me. I expanded my arms, and
presented my breast, exclaiming, “Strike!&mdash;this
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_330" title="330"> </a>
is the consummation of monastic
power,&mdash;it begun by violating nature, and
ends in filicide. Strike! give a glorious
triumph to the influence of the church,
and add to the merits of the holy Director.
You have sacrificed your Esau, your
first-born, already, let Jacob be your next
victim.” My father retreated from me,
and, revolted by the disfigurement which
the violence of my agitation had caused,
almost to convulsion, he exclaimed, “Demon!”
and stood at a distance viewing,
and shuddering at me. “And who has
made me so? <em>He</em> who fostered my evil
passions for his own purposes; and, because
one generous impulse breaks out on
the side of nature, would represent or
drive me mad, to effectuate his purposes.
My father, I see the whole power and system
of nature reversed, by the arts of a
corrupt ecclesiastic. By his means my
brother has been imprisoned for life;&mdash;by
his means our birth has been made a curse
to my mother and to you. What have
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_331" title="331"> </a>
we had in the family since his influence
was fatally established in it, but dissension
and misery? Your sword was pointed against
my heart this moment; was it nature
or a monk that armed a parent against
his child, whose crime was&mdash;interceding for
his brother? Dismiss this man, whose
presence eclipses our hearts, and let us
confer together for a moment as father and
son, and if I do not humiliate myself before
you, spurn me for ever. My father,
for God’s sake examine the difference between
this man and me, as we stand before
you. We are together at the bar of
your heart, judge between us. A dry and
featureless image of selfish power, consecrated
by the name of the church, occupies
his whole soul,&mdash;I plead to you by
the interests of nature, that must be sincere,
because they are contrary to my own.
He only wishes to wither your soul,&mdash;I
seek to touch it. Is his heart in what he
says? does he shed a tear? does he employ
one impassioned expression? he calls
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_332" title="332"> </a>
on God,&mdash;while I call only on you. The
very violence which you justly condemn,
is not only my vindication but my eulogy.
They who prefer their cause to themselves,
need no proof of their advocacy being sincere.”
“You aggravate your crime, by
laying it on another; you have always
been violent, obstinate, and rebellious.”
“But who has made me so? Ask himself,&mdash;ask
this shameful scene, in which his duplicity
has driven me to act such a part.”
“If you wish to show submission, give
me the first proof of it, by promising never
to torture me by renewing the mention of
this subject. Your brother’s fate is decided,&mdash;promise
not to utter his name again,
and<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>” “Never,&mdash;never,” I exclaimed,
“never will I violate my conscience
by such a vow; and his who could propose
it must be seared beyond the power
of Heaven to touch it.” Yet, in uttering
these words, I knelt to my father,
but he turned from me. I turned in
despair to the Director. I said, “If
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_333" title="333"> </a>
you are the minister of Heaven, prove
the truth of your commission,&mdash;make
peace in a distracted family, reconcile my
father to both his children. You can effect
this by a word, you know you can,
yet you will not utter it. My unfortunate
brother was not so inflexible to your appeals,
and yet were they inspired by a
feeling as justifiable as mine.” I had offended
the Director beyond all forgiveness.
I knew this, and spoke indeed rather
to expose than to persuade him. I
did not expect an answer from him, and I
was not disappointed,&mdash;he did not utter a
word. I knelt in the middle of the floor
between them. I cried, “Deserted by my
father and by you, I yet appeal to Heaven.
I call on it to witness my vow never to abandon
my persecuted brother, whom I
have been made a tool to betray. I know
you have power,&mdash;I defy it. I know every
art of circumvention, of imposture, of malignant
industry,&mdash;every resource of earth
and hell, will be set at work against me.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_334" title="334"> </a>
I take Heaven to witness against you, and
demand only its aid to insure my victory.”
My father had lost all patience; he desired
the attendants to raise and remove me by
force. This mention of force, so repugnant
to my habits of imperious indulgence,
operated fatally on intellects scarcely recovering
from delirium, and too strongly
tried in the late struggle. I relapsed into
partial insanity. I said wildly, “My father,
you know not how mild, generous,
and forgiving is the being you thus persecute,&mdash;I
owe my life to him. <em>Ask your
domestics if he did not attend me, step by
step, during my journey?</em> If he did not
administer my food, my medicines, and
smoothe the pillows on which I was supported?”
“You rave,” cried my father, as
he heard this wild speech, but he cast a
look of fearful inquiry on the attendants.
The trembling servants swore, one and all,
as well they might, that not a human being
but themselves had been suffered to
approach me since I quitted the convent,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_335" title="335"> </a>
till my arrival at Madrid. The small remains
of reason forsook me completely at
this <ins title="delaration">declaration</ins>, which was however true
every word of it. I gave the lie to the
last speaker with the utmost fury,&mdash;I
struck those who were next me. My father,
astonished at my violence, suddenly
exclaimed, “He is mad.” The Director,
who had till then been silent, instantly
caught the word, and repeated, “He is
mad.” The servants, half in terror, half
in conviction, re-echoed the cry.</p>

<p>“I was seized, dragged away; and this
violence, which always excited corresponding
violence in me, realized all my father
feared, and the Director wished for. I
behaved just as a boy, scarce out of a fever,
and still totally delirious, might be supposed
to behave. In my apartment I tore
down the hangings, and there was not a
porcelain vase in the room that I did not
dash at their heads. When they seized
me, I bit their hands; when at length
they were compelled to bind me, I gnawed
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_336" title="336"> </a>
the strings, and finally snapt them by a
violent effort. In fact, I completely
realized all the hopes of the Director. I
was confined to my apartment for several
days. During this time, I recovered the
only powers that usually revive in a state
of isolation,&mdash;those of inflexible resolution
and profound dissimulation. I had soon
exercise enough for both of them. On
the twelfth day of my confinement, a servant
appeared at the door of my apartment,
and, bowing profoundly, announced,
that if my health was recovered, my father
wished to see me. I bowed in complete
imitation of his mechanical movements,
and followed him with the steps of
a statue. I found my father, armed with
the Director at his side. He advanced,
and addressed me with an abruptness
which proved that he forced himself to
speak. He hurried over a few expressions
of pleasure at my recovery, and then said,
“Have you reflected on the subject of our
last conversation?” “I have <em>reflected on
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_337" title="337"> </a>
it</em>.”&mdash;“<em>I had time to do so.</em>”&mdash;“And you
have employed that time well?”&mdash;“I hope
so.”&mdash;“Then the result will be favourable
to the hopes of your family, and the interests
of the church.” The last words
chilled me a little, but I answered as I
ought. In a few moments after the Director
joined me, He spoke amicably,
and turned the conversation on neutral
topics. I answered him,&mdash;what an effort
did it cost me!&mdash;yet I answered him in all
the bitterness of extorted politeness. All
went on well, however. The family appeared
gratified by my renovation. My
father, harassed out, was content to procure
peace on any terms. My mother,
still weaker, from the struggles between
her conscience and the suggestions of
the Director, wept, and said she was happy.
A month has now elapsed in profound
but treacherous peace on all sides.
They think me subdued, but *
* * * *</p>

<p>“In fact, the efforts of the Director’s
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_338" title="338"> </a>
power in the family would alone be sufficient
to precipitate my determinations. He
has placed you in a convent, but that is
not enough for the persevering proselytism
of the church. The palace of the
Duke de Monçada is, under his influence,
turned into a convent itself. My mother
is almost a nun, her whole life is exhausted
in imploring forgiveness for a crime for
which the Director, to secure his own influence,
orders her a new penance every
hour. My father rushes from libertinism
to austerity,&mdash;he vacillates between this
world and the next;&mdash;in the bitterness of
exasperated feeling, sometimes reproaches
my mother, and then joins her in the severest
penance. Must there not be something
very wrong in the religion which
thus substitutes external severities for internal
amendment? I feel I am of an inquiring
spirit, and if I could obtain a
book they call the Bible, (which, though
they say it contains the words of Jesus
Christ, they never permit us to see) I think<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>but
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_339" title="339"> </a>
no matter. The very domestics
have assumed the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in ordine ad spiritualia</i>
character already. They converse in whispers&mdash;they
cross themselves when the clock
strikes&mdash;they dare to talk, even in my hearing,
of the glory which will redound to
God and the church, by the sacrifice my
father may yet be induced to make of his
family to its interests.</p>

<p class="center">* &emsp; * &emsp; * &emsp; *</p>

<p>“My fever has abated&mdash;I have not lost
a moment in consulting your interests&mdash;I
have heard that there is a possibility of
your reclaiming your vows&mdash;that is, as I
have been told, of declaring they were extorted
under impressions of fraud and terror.
Observe me, Alonzo, I would rather
see you rot in a convent, than behold you
stand forth as a living witness of our mother’s
shame. But I am instructed that
this reclamation of your vows may be carried
on in a civil court: If this be practicable,
you may yet be free, and I shall be
happy. Do not hesitate for resources, I
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_340" title="340"> </a>
am able to supply them. If you do not
fail in resolution, I have no doubt of our
ultimate success.&mdash;<em>Ours</em> I term it, for I
shall not know a moment’s peace till you
are emancipated. With the half of my
yearly allowance I have bribed one of the
domestics, who is brother to the porter of
the convent, to convey these lines to you.
Answer me by the same channel, it is secret
and secure. You must, I understand, furnish
a memorial, to be put into the hands
of an advocate. It must be strongly worded,&mdash;but
remember, not a word of our unfortunate
mother;&mdash;I blush to say this to
her son. Procure paper by some means.
If you find any difficulty, I will furnish
you; but, to avoid suspicion, and too frequent
recurrences to the porter, try to do
it yourself. Your conventual duties will
furnish you with a pretext of writing out
your confession,&mdash;I will undertake for its
safe delivery. I commend you to the
holy keeping of God,&mdash;not the God of
monks and directors, but the God of nature
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_341" title="341"> </a>
and mercy.<span style="white-space: nowrap;">&mdash;&mdash;</span>I am your affectionate
brother,</p>

<p class="right small-caps">Juan di Monçada.”</p>

<p>“Such were the contents of the papers
which I received in fragments, and from
time to time, by the hands of the porter.
I swallowed the first the moment I had
read it, and the rest I found means to destroy
unperceived as I received them,&mdash;my
attendance on the infirmary entitling me
to great indulgences.”</p>

<p>At this part of the narrative, the Spaniard
became so much agitated, though
apparently more from emotion than fatigue,
that Melmoth intreated him to suspend it
for some days, and the exhausted narrator
willingly complied.</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
